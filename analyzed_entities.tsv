Agent	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Agent	+R	+O	+U	+D	Sortal	Agent is considered a sortal because it provides an intrinsic identity condition for its instances, making them entities with inherent existence and continuity. Its rigidity implies that agents do not change their essential nature over time, and its unity suggests that agents are autonomous, integrated units with inherent wholeness. Finally, agents' dependence on themselves for existence reflects their self-sustaining nature.

Animal	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Animal	+R	-I	-U	+D	Sortal	Animal is a sortal because it encompasses a range of rigidly distinct entities, such as mammal, bird, fish, etc. Its non-unity (animals can be broken down into constituent parts) is reflected in its inherent dependence on other factors, like habitat, diet, and environment, which are essential for its existence. Its lack of own identity condition (the property does not supply its own IC) indicates that its identity is carried from a more general category, and it cannot be considered as a whole with its constituent parts.	
Apple	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Apple	-R	-I	-U	-D	Sortal	The Apple is a sortal because it is a specific, essential kind of thing that can be distinguished from other things. However, it is not rigid because its instances (e.g. red apple, green apple) can be differentiated based on other characteristics. It does not carry its own identity condition, nor is it an intrinsic whole, nor is it dependent on something else for its existence. Instead, it is an independent object that can exist on its own.	
Butterfly	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Butterfly	-R	-I	-U	+D	Mixin	Butterfly is a mixin because it is not a sortal entity, but rather a property of something (e.g., a chrysalis), and its rigidity is not essential. Its identity is not self-sufficient, but rather inherited from its subsuming property 'insect'. As a whole, butterflies are not a unified entity, but rather a collection of distinct parts (wings, legs, etc.). Finally, butterflies depend on the chrysalis for their existence.	
Caterpillar	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Caterpillar	~R	-I	~U	+D	Mixin	A Caterpillar is a non-essential, non-whole, dependent entity. It does not have a fixed identity condition, but rather carries an identity condition from its subsuming property, being a Lifeform. The entity relies on something else (the Habitat) to exist and is a characteristic of the species 'Butterfly'. Hence, it is a mixin and its rigidity, unity, and identity are best described as non-essential.	
Country	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Country	+R	+O	+U	+D	Sortal	Country is a sortal because it has rigidity, identity, unity, and dependence. It is a sortal because it describes a category of entities with intrinsic boundaries and essential characteristics (e.g., a country has a specific territory and set of citizens). The property of identity is essential to being a country, and the property of unity is necessary to define a country as a cohesive unit. Finally, countries depend on their territories and populations to exist.	
Entity	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Entity	+R	+O	+U	-D	Sortal	Entity is a sortal because it is an intrinsic category that describes a fundamental, essential aspect of a thing. It is rigid in the sense that being an entity is essential to its instances in all possible worlds. The entity's identity condition is its own intrinsic being, making it own-identity. The entity is an unifying category, as instances are the fundamental, intrinsic units. Finally, entities are independent in the sense that they can exist alone without reliance on something else.	
Food	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Food	-R	-I	-U	+D	Mixin	Food is a mixin because it is not a rigid, essential property of its instances, and does not supply its own identity condition. It is not an intrinsic whole and does not provide an identity condition to its instances. However, its instances depend on other things to exist, such as farmers, production processes, and nutrients. This dependence is due to the physical and biological processes involved in the growth, harvesting, and preparation of food, as well as its nutritional and health properties. This dependence reflects the ontological dependency of food instances on various factors to realize their characteristics and functionality.	
Fruit	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Fruit	-R	-I	-U	-D	Mixin	Fruit is a mixin because it is not a rigidity, it does not supply its own identity condition, it is not an intrinsic whole, and it does not depend on something else to exist. Fruit instances are just a collection of properties that can be attributed to them without any intrinsic identity or unity.	
Group	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Group	~R	+I	+U	+D	Sortal	Group is a sortal because it has unity (instances are collections of entities), independence (individual entities within the group can exist alone), and identity (it has a distinct existence). Rigidity is not essential for all instances, as different subsets can be considered a group. However, it is anti-rigid, as instances can change without ceasing to be a group, such as through addition or removal of members.	
GroupOfPeople	http://example.org/guarino-messy#GroupOfPeople	+R	+O	+U	-D	Role	GroupOfPeople is considered a rigid entity because it always refers to a collection of individuals who share some common characteristics. It has an identity condition based on its members, as the group's identity is tied to its members' identities. Additionally, GroupOfPeople can be considered a unified entity because it is a single entity that comprises multiple individuals. Finally, it is not dependent on a single individual or entity, as it can exist without being tied to a specific person or group leader.	
LegalAgent	http://example.org/guarino-messy#LegalAgent	+R	+O	-U	-D	Sortal	LegalAgent is a sortal because it is essential to all its instances (e.g., Person, Corporation) and supplies its own Identity Condition (IC). It is not an intrinsic whole (not unifying), and its instances do not depend on anything else to exist.	
LivingBeing	http://example.org/guarino-messy#LivingBeing	+R	-I	-U	+D	Sortal	LivingBeing is a sortal because it's an essential and intrinsic characteristic (R+). Its lack of intrinsic identity (I-) suggests it's not a property that supplies its own identity condition. Living beings can exist independently of each other (D+), and they do not form intrinsic wholes (U-). These properties point to LivingBeing as a sortal representing a category of entities rather than a role or mixin.	
Location	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Location	+R	-I	+U	-D	Sortal	Location is a sortal because it describes a location-specific entity, which has a definite spatial identity and is considered an intrinsic whole. It does not depend on anything else to exist, and the concept of Location applies to all instances without modification.	
Organization	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Organization	+R	-I	-U	+D	Sortal	Organization is a sortal because it supplies its own Identity Condition (e.g., an Organization has its members and operations as its IC). It's non-unifying because instances are composed of many people, and its instances are not necessarily wholes. Organization is also dependent on its members and operations to exist.	
Person	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Person	+R	+O	-U	+D	Sortal	Person is considered rigid as it is essential to all its instances to exist (e.g., every person has personal identity, consciousness, etc.). It is also considered a sortal because it categorizes entities based on their fundamental properties and characteristics. Person's unity is negative because it is not an intrinsic whole, but rather a collection of various attributes and characteristics. Finally, person is considered dependent on other properties such as health, location, and family because it can exist and function without these attributes, but its existence is heavily influenced by them.	
PhysicalObject	http://example.org/guarino-messy#PhysicalObject	+R	+O	+U	+D	Sortal	PhysicalObject is a sortal because it describes a general category of things that share essential properties. Rigidity applies because a PhysicalObject must exist in its entirety and not be decomposed into parts (e.g., a chair can't be just legs). Identity carries over because a PhysicalObject has a natural identity condition (IC) as itself. Unity applies because a PhysicalObject is considered a unified whole. Dependence applies because a PhysicalObject depends on physical laws and relations to exist and persist.	
Red	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Red	~R	-I	-U	-D	Mixin	The color Red is not rigid in the sense that it can be possessed by different objects (e.g., apples, flowers) without those objects changing into something else. Red is not an identity condition, as an object can exist without being red (e.g., white). It is not a unifying property, as a mixture of red and other colors can still be considered red. Finally, red does not depend on anything else to exist, as it is a basic color property of objects.	
RedApple	http://example.org/guarino-messy#RedApple	+R	-I	-U	-D	Sortal	RedApple is considered a sortal because it is an intrinsic, essential property that determines the individual identity of the entity. It is not dependent on anything else to exist, and instances of RedApple are not aggregates. The RedApple's rigidity ensures that its essential properties are preserved across all possible worlds. This classification aligns with the philosophical notion of a kind or sort, which is essential for distinguishing between different instances of the same entity.	
SocialEntity	http://example.org/guarino-messy#SocialEntity	-R	-I	-U	+D	Sortal	SocialEntity is a sortal because it has non-essential properties and does not provide its own identity condition, instead carrying an identity condition inherited from a subsuming property. Its instances are not necessarily intrinsic wholes or sums/aggregates, but can exist alone as entities. Finally, instances of SocialEntity intrinsically depend on something else to exist, such as families, groups, or organizations.	
Vertebrate	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Vertebrate	+R	+O	-U	+D	Sortal	Vertebrate is a sortal because its instances (animals) share a common intrinsic property, being vertebrates, and are not merely aggregations or sums of distinct parts. It is an essential identity condition, as vertebrates must possess a vertebral column to exist. The term is not unifying because vertebrates come in various forms, such as fish and tetrapods. Vertebrates depend on other entities to exist, as they need a womb and nourishment to develop, but they are not mere aggregates of these entities.
