            "Entity -> Universal: The 'end of flying' in the context of travel and tourism likely refers to a conceptual or abstract idea that can apply to multiple instances or scenarios, such as the broader end of flying practices or trends. In ontological terms, a 'Universal' denotes a type or generic concept that can be instantiated by numerous entities, fitting the description of 'end of flying' as a general concept in travel and tourism.",
            "Universal -> Sortal: The entity 'end of flying' refers to a specific kind or phase of an activity, suggesting a classification as a 'Sortal'. Sortals are typically kinds or types that allow for the identification of distinct entities or phases, like the end phase of flying in travel and tourism.",
            "Sortal -> Phase: The 'end of flying' in the context of travel and tourism represents a non-rigid stage or phase in the life cycle of a journey or travel process. It denotes a transitional state where the flying aspect of the journey concludes. Since 'Phase' is defined as a non-rigid sortal that represents a stage in a life cycle, it fits well as a subclass for 'end of flying'."
