Butterfly	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Butterfly	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Sortal (Rigid, supplies identity)	Butterfly is rigid because any entity that is a butterfly is necessarily a butterfly in all possible worlds where it exists. A butterfly cannot cease to be a butterfly and remain the same individual - it is an essential biological kind. While a caterpillar can become a butterfly through metamorphosis, they are not the same persisting individual under standard biological identity criteria; rather, metamorphosis represents a transformation where the organism fundamentally changes its identity as a life stage. Once something is a butterfly (the adult stage of Lepidoptera), it cannot cease to be one while continuing to exist as the same entity.	Butterfly carries an identity condition. As a biological organism, each butterfly instance can be distinguished and re-identified through various means: DNA sequence, specific physical characteristics, spatio-temporal continuity of the individual organism, and developmental history from egg through larva and pupa stages. A butterfly is a rigid property (once a butterfly, always a butterfly during its existence as that life stage) that supplies its own identity condition - we can determine whether two butterfly observations at different times refer to the same individual butterfly through biological and physical criteria. This satisfies the requirement for +I as a sortal property.	Butterfly supplies its own identity condition as a rigid natural kind property. As a biological organism kind, it provides a global identity condition based on having the same continuous life history and biological individual identity (from egg through larva, pupa, to adult butterfly). This IC is not inherited from a more general sortal like 'Insect' or 'Animal' because Butterfly specifies the particular developmental pattern and biological continuity that makes a butterfly the same individual butterfly over time. While it subsumes more general biological categories, Butterfly itself establishes the specific identity criteria for what makes one butterfly numerically identical to itself across its metamorphic life stages, thus supplying (+O) rather than merely carrying (-O) an identity condition.	A butterfly is an intrinsic whole with a clear unity condition based on biological organization and functional integration. Each butterfly instance maintains topological unity (spatially connected body parts) and functional unity (integrated biological systems including wings, thorax, abdomen, circulatory, nervous, and digestive systems) throughout its existence as a butterfly. The parts of a butterfly (wings, antennae, legs, etc.) are not arbitrary but are necessarily connected through biological structure and work as an integrated organism. This unity persists essentially throughout the butterfly's life - if the organism loses this integrated wholeness, it ceases to be a butterfly. Therefore, all instances of Butterfly are intrinsic wholes under an equivalence relation based on biological connectivity and functional integration.	A butterfly, as an individual organism, does not have external notional dependence on other entities. While butterflies require environmental conditions (air, temperature, food sources) and evolved from caterpillars, any particular butterfly instance exists as an independent biological entity. It does not necessarily require the existence of another specific entity (that is not a part or constituent of itself) to exist. The butterfly has all necessary parts and constitution within itself as a complete organism, making it externally independent according to the formal definition.	
Red	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Red	-R	-I	-O	~U	+D	Attribution (Non-rigid, no identity)	Red is a non-rigid property because it is not essential to all its instances. An object can be red at one time and cease to be red at another time (e.g., through painting, fading, or natural color change) while remaining the same individual object. For example, a car can be red today and painted blue tomorrow, remaining the same car. Since instances can move in and out of the property RED while maintaining their identity, it is non-rigid (-R) rather than rigid (+R). It is not anti-rigid (~R) because there's no requirement that all red things must contingently be red - some objects might theoretically be essentially red, even if most are not.	Red is a quality or attribute that does not carry an identity condition. There is no principled way to distinguish or re-identify individual instances of redness across time and space. When we encounter red in different objects or at different times, we cannot establish whether it is 'the same red' or different instances of red, as qualities do not have individuation criteria independent of their bearers. Red lacks the necessary conditions (like spatio-temporal continuity, intrinsic structure, or unique identifiers) that would allow us to track a specific instance of redness over time. This is a classic example of a non-sortal property.	Red is a quality/property that does not supply its own identity condition. As a quality, Red does not have an identity condition to provide - qualities are identified through their bearers and characteristics, not through their own intrinsic identity criteria. Since Red was determined to be -I (does not carry identity), it cannot be +O, as +O requires +I. Red entities are not individuated as 'the same red' across instances; rather, each instance of red is identified through the object that bears it.	Red is a quality or property that can be instantiated by completely disconnected, scattered objects without any mereological integration. There is no unity condition that binds together all red things - a red car, a red balloon, and a red building have no intrinsic wholeness relation omega that connects their parts. Red things form an arbitrary collection based solely on sharing a color property, not on being integrated wholes. Individual instances of red things (like 'this red car') might themselves be wholes, but the property Red itself does not carry a unity condition - it has anti-unity (~U) since the property does not require or impose any mereological integration on its instances as a class.	Red is a color quality that cannot exist independently - it must inhere in some physical object or surface. A particular instance of redness (e.g., 'the red of this apple') is externally dependent on the existence of a colored entity (the apple) that bears this quality. Following the definition, for any instance of Red to exist, there must necessarily exist some instance of a physical entity that it qualifies, which is not a part of the redness itself but rather the bearer of this property. This makes Red externally dependent, marked as +D.	
Food	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Food	-R	-I	-O	-U	-D	Attribution (Non-rigid, no identity)	Food is non-rigid because an entity can become food or cease to be food while remaining the same entity. For example, a plant growing in nature is not food, but when harvested and prepared for consumption, it becomes food. Similarly, food that spoils or is disposed of may cease to be food while the matter continues to exist. The property of being food is contingent upon context, purpose, and state, rather than being essential to the identity of the entity in all possible worlds.	Food does not carry an identity condition. Food is a functional/role property that depends on context and purpose (nutritive function for organisms) rather than intrinsic features. The same physical matter can be food at one time and not food at another (e.g., edible fruit vs. rotten fruit), and there's no principled way to re-identify 'the same food' across time - we can only track the underlying physical substance (amount of matter). When we speak of 'the same food,' we're either referring to the same portion of matter or the same type/kind, but food itself doesn't supply criteria for distinguishing one instance from another independent of the underlying material substance.	Food is -I (carries no identity condition), as determined by the Identity analysis. According to the constraint '+O implies +I', if an entity does not carry an identity condition (-I), it cannot supply one. Food is a role/non-sortal property - the same physical matter can be food at one time and not food at another (a sandwich is food, but once digested it is no longer food). It does not supply its own identity condition; any identity would be inherited from what the food actually is (e.g., a particular apple as a physical object). Therefore, Food is -O.	Food does not carry a unity condition because its instances do not share a common intrinsic wholeness criterion. Food can be: an integrated biological whole (an apple, a fish), a functionally unified artifact (a sandwich, a cake), a scattered aggregate (a bowl of rice grains, a bag of chips), or an arbitrary amount of matter (milk in a glass, soup). There is no single equivalence relation omega that makes all instances of Food intrinsic wholes - some instances are wholes under various criteria (topological, morphological, functional), while others are mere quantities or collections. The property Food is defined by its functional role (being edible/nutritive) rather than by any mereological structure, making it -U rather than +U or ~U.	Food instances are independent entities that do not require external dependence on other entities for their existence. While food may be consumed by organisms and may have originated from other sources (plants, animals), once it exists as food, it does not intrinsically depend on any specific external entity to continue existing. A piece of bread, an apple, or a portion of cooked meat exists independently without necessarily requiring a consumer, producer, or any other entity to be present. The food itself maintains its existence as a physical substance regardless of whether it is eaten, stored, or left unused. This is distinct from relational properties like 'Student' which cannot exist without an educational institution.	
Animal	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Animal	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Sortal (Rigid, supplies identity)	Animal is a rigid property because any entity that is an animal is necessarily an animal in all possible worlds. An animal cannot cease to be an animal while remaining the same individual - it is an essential biological classification that defines the fundamental nature of its instances. Like Person, this is a sortal property that provides essential identity criteria for its instances throughout their existence.	Animal carries an identity condition. As a natural kind and rigid property (animals remain animals throughout their existence), each animal instance can be reliably distinguished and re-identified over time through biological continuity. Animals have clear spatio-temporal continuity, maintaining identity despite cellular replacement and growth. They possess inherent characteristics (DNA, biological organization, developmental history) that provide necessary and sufficient conditions for both synchronic identity (distinguishing one animal from another at the same time) and diachronic identity (recognizing the same animal at different times). This makes Animal a sortal property that supplies its own identity condition.	Animal supplies its own identity condition. As a fundamental biological category, Animal provides a global identity criterion based on being a continuous living organism with biological continuity over time. This is distinct from more general properties like Physical Object (which uses spatiotemporal continuity) or Amount of Matter (which uses mereological extensionality). The identity of an animal persists through material replacement (cells are replaced over time) and depends on biological/organismal continuity rather than mere physical composition. Since Animal is rigid (once an animal, always an animal throughout existence) and provides this specific biological basis for identity that is not inherited from a more specific property, it supplies its own IC.	Animal carries a unity condition (+U) because all instances of Animal are intrinsic wholes with a biological unity condition. Each animal is an integrated organism where parts (organs, cells, tissues) are functionally and topologically connected throughout its existence. The parts of an animal maintain systematic physiological relationships - they work together as a unified biological system. An animal cannot lose or gain arbitrary parts while remaining the same animal in the way that a scattered collection could. The biological organization that makes something an animal constitutes an equivalence relation omega that holds for all parts at all times during the animal's existence, satisfying the definition of an intrinsic whole under Definition 10.	Animal instances can exist independently without necessarily depending on other specific entities external to themselves. While animals may have biological relationships (predator-prey, symbiosis) or environmental dependencies, these are not ontologically necessary for their existence as animals. An animal exists as an animal by virtue of its intrinsic biological properties (being alive, having certain cellular structures, etc.), not by virtue of a necessary relationship to some other entity. The dependence meta-property concerns external notional dependence where an instance cannot exist without some other distinct entity existing - this does not apply to animals as a category.	
RedApple	http://example.org/guarino-messy#RedApple	-R	+I	-O	+U	-D	Category or Mixin (Non-rigid)	RedApple is non-rigid because an instance can lose the property of being red while remaining the same individual apple. An apple can ripen from green to red, or decay and turn brown, without ceasing to exist as that particular apple. The redness is not essential to the apple's identity across all possible worlds - we can imagine the same apple in a state where it is not red. Therefore, RedApple is not rigid (+R), but since not all apples must necessarily be non-red at some point (some could theoretically remain red throughout their existence), it is not anti-rigid (~R) either. It is simply non-rigid (-R).	RedApple carries an identity condition inherited from its subsuming rigid properties. As a type of physical object/apple, instances of RedApple can be distinguished and re-identified through spatio-temporal continuity and material composition. Each red apple maintains its identity over time as a discrete physical entity - the same red apple can be tracked from one moment to the next through spatial location and physical continuity. While 'red' alone does not supply identity (-I), and the property RedApple may be non-rigid (an apple can change color), it carries the IC supplied by more general rigid properties like APPLE or PHYSICAL OBJECT. According to Definition 4, a non-rigid property carries an IC if it is subsumed by a rigid property carrying that IC. Therefore, RedApple is +I (a sortal).	RedApple does not supply its own identity condition. As a phase sortal (an apple that is temporarily red), it inherits its identity condition from the more fundamental rigid property APPLE or PHYSICAL OBJECT. The redness is a contingent phase property - an apple can change from green to red while remaining the same apple. The identity of a red apple through time is determined by its being the same apple (supplied by APPLE), not by criteria specific to RedApple itself. Therefore, while RedApple carries an IC (+I) inherited from its subsuming properties, it does not supply its own IC (-O).	RedApple instances are intrinsic wholes with clear topological, morphological, and functional unity. Each red apple is a biological organism (or fruit body) with integrated parts (skin, flesh, core, seeds) that are topologically connected and functionally organized. The parts of a red apple maintain their mereological structure throughout the apple's existence as a red apple - if the apple is broken apart, it ceases to be a red apple (though it may remain an apple or become apple pieces). This satisfies the definition of an intrinsic whole under a unity condition, as all instances have integrated structure bound by topological and functional connection relations.	RedApple is independent because instances of red apples do not intrinsically require the existence of other external entities to exist. A red apple exists as a complete physical object on its own - it doesn't depend on another separate entity like PARENT depends on CHILD or STUDENT depends on SCHOOL. While a red apple may have parts (skin, flesh, seeds) and may be constituted of matter, these are internal constituents, not external dependencies. The definition of external dependence requires that 'some instance of ψ must exist, which is not a part nor a constituent of x' - but red apples have no such external existential requirement.	
Group	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Group	+R	+I	+O	~U	-D	Sortal (Rigid, supplies identity)	Group is a rigid property because anything that is a group is necessarily a group in all possible worlds where it exists. A group is defined by its essential collective nature - it is fundamentally a collection or aggregate of entities considered as a unit. While the membership of a group may change (members can join or leave), the entity itself remains essentially a group. An entity cannot be a group in one possible world and not a group in another while maintaining its identity as that same entity. The property of being a group is an essential, category-level classification rather than a contingent phase or role.	Group carries an identity condition. A group can be distinguished and re-identified over time through its membership composition and organizational structure. Two groups are the same if they have the same members organized in the same way. Groups maintain identity across time even as they perform different activities or are in different states. For example, 'The Beatles' remains identifiable as the same group throughout its existence, and we can distinguish it from other groups like 'The Rolling Stones'. The identity condition is based on the collection of members and their organizational relationships, allowing for synchronic (at a given time) and diachronic (across time) identification of group instances.	Group supplies its own identity condition. A group has an identity based on its membership configuration - two groups are the same if they have the same members in the same structural relationships. This is distinct from and not inherited from more general properties. While groups are composed of members, the identity condition 'having the same members' is supplied by the GROUP property itself, not inherited from a more general sortal. This is a fundamental identity criterion that GROUP establishes for its instances.	Group is a paradigmatic case of anti-unity (~U). By definition, a group is a collection of distinct entities that remain separate and are not integrated into a single whole with a unified mereological structure. The members of a group maintain their individual identity and independence - they are not bound by any intrinsic equivalence relation that would make the group an intrinsic whole. A group is essentially a scattered object or aggregate: its 'parts' (members) lack the topological, morphological, or functional integration that would qualify it as a whole. For example, a group of people standing together remains a mere plurality of individuals, not a unified entity with integrated parts like an organism or a functional artifact would be.	A Group is independent because its instances do not intrinsically depend on specific external entities for their existence. While a group consists of members, these members are parts/constituents of the group itself, not external entities. According to the definition, external dependence requires the dependent entity to rely on something that is 'not a part nor a constituent' of it. Since group members are constituents of the group, and the group is fundamentally defined by its membership composition, Group does not exhibit external notional dependence. A group can exist as a collective entity without depending on entities external to its own structure.	
Country	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Country	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Sortal (Rigid, supplies identity)	Country is a rigid property because anything that is a country is necessarily a country in all possible worlds where it exists. While the territory, government, or population of a country may change, and a country may cease to exist entirely, an entity cannot be a country in one possible world and not a country in another while maintaining its identity as the same entity. The property of being a country is essential to any instance of country - if something is a country, it must be a country throughout its existence. This differs from contingent properties like 'democratic country' or 'member of UN' which a country can gain or lose while remaining the same country.	Country carries an identity condition. Countries can be distinguished and re-identified across time through multiple sufficient and necessary identity criteria: geographical boundaries (territorial extent), sovereign government status, international recognition, and legal continuity of statehood. Even when countries undergo significant changes (regime changes, border modifications, name changes), there are principled ways to track their identity diachronically. For example, France remains the same country despite territorial changes, government transitions, and constitutional reforms. The property Country supplies its own identity conditions related to sovereignty and territorial integrity, making it +I and likely +O as well.	Country supplies its own identity condition as a rigid property. A country maintains its identity through specific criteria such as territorial sovereignty, governmental continuity, and international recognition status - even as governments change, populations shift, or boundaries are modified. The identity condition for a country is distinct from and not inherited from more general properties like 'Geographic Region' or 'Political Entity'. For example, France remains the same country despite regime changes, and this identity is supplied by the specific nature of what constitutes a country, not by a more general sortal. Country is rigid (something cannot become or cease to be a country in different contexts while remaining the same entity) and provides its own global identity criteria.	Country carries unity condition (+U) because each instance is an intrinsic whole under geopolitical and territorial unity. A country's parts (regions, provinces, territories) are bound together by a common sovereignty, legal system, and territorial continuity that defines it as a unified political entity. The parts of a country are not arbitrary - they are integrated through governmental structure, legal jurisdiction, and territorial boundaries. A country maintains this unity condition throughout its existence as that particular country; if the unity condition fails (e.g., through dissolution or partition), it ceases to be the same country. Examples like France or Japan demonstrate that countries are wholes with integrated territorial and political parts, not mere aggregates of land or scattered objects.	A Country does not intrinsically depend on other external entities for its existence. While countries interact with other countries and may have historical origins involving other entities, a country as a geopolitical entity can exist independently. It has its own territory, population, and governance structure that constitute it. The dependencies countries have (e.g., diplomatic recognition, trade partners) are not necessary external dependencies in the ontological sense - a country can exist without any specific other country or external entity existing. The territory, population, and government that constitute a country are parts or constituents of it, not external entities it depends upon.	
AmountOfMatter	http://example.org/guarino-messy#AmountOfMatter	+R	-I	-O	~U	-D	Attribution or Quality	AmountOfMatter is rigid because any instance that is an amount of matter is necessarily so in all possible worlds. An amount of matter is defined by mereological extensionality (having the same parts), which is an essential property. If an entity loses or gains any part, it becomes a different amount of matter rather than the same amount that has changed. This is fundamentally different from, say, a Person who can replace parts while remaining the same person. The identity of an amount of matter is necessarily tied to its exact composition, making this property essential to all its instances.	AmountOfMatter does not carry an identity condition. While amounts of matter can be quantified (e.g., '5kg of water'), there is no principled way to distinguish one instance from another or re-identify the same instance over time. If you divide an amount of matter into two parts and later recombine them, or swap some portion with an identical portion, there is no intrinsic property that determines identity. The matter itself has no inherent IC - what counts as 'the same' amount of matter depends entirely on arbitrary tracking decisions (like putting it in a container), not on any condition supplied by the property itself. This is explicitly mentioned in the background text as a paradigmatic example of -I.	Given that this entity was determined to be -I (does not carry identity), it cannot be +O. The constraint states that +O implies +I - you cannot supply an identity condition without carrying one. AmountOfMatter does not supply its own identity condition because it does not carry any identity condition at all.	AmountOfMatter is a paradigmatic example of anti-unity (~U). As explicitly stated in the background text, 'Amount of Matter is usually an example of the latter kind, since none of its instances can be intrinsic wholes.' Instances of AmountOfMatter are pure quantities of substance without any inherent unity condition - they lack integrated mereological structure and their parts are arbitrarily determined. An amount of matter can be divided, scattered, or reaggregated without ceasing to be an amount of matter of the same substance. There is no equivalence relation omega that makes all parts of an amount of matter maximally self-connected as required for being an intrinsic whole. The parts of an amount of matter are held together (if at all) by external spatial arrangement rather than any internal unity principle.	AmountOfMatter represents a quantity or measure of physical substance. Instances of amounts of matter (e.g., 5 kilograms of water, 2 moles of carbon) do not intrinsically depend on other entities external to themselves for their existence. The matter itself exists independently - while it may be measured, contained, or related to other entities, these relationships are not necessary for the amount of matter to exist. The substance that constitutes the amount is self-sufficient and does not require external entities (beyond its own constituent parts) to exist. Unlike dependent entities such as PARENT (which requires CHILD) or STUDENT (which requires an educational institution), an amount of matter simply exists as a quantity of physical substance without such external dependencies.	
PhysicalObject	http://example.org/guarino-messy#PhysicalObject	+R	+I	+O	-U	-D	Sortal (Rigid, supplies identity)	PhysicalObject is a rigid property because anything that is a physical object is necessarily a physical object in all possible worlds where it exists. An entity cannot cease to be a physical object while remaining the same individual - if something is physical, this is an essential characteristic that it must maintain throughout its existence. It cannot transition between being physical and non-physical while maintaining its identity. This makes PhysicalObject a sortal property that provides essential identity conditions for its instances.	PhysicalObject carries an identity condition based on spatio-temporal continuity. Physical objects can be distinguished and re-identified across time through their continuous existence in space-time, even as their parts may change. They maintain diachronic identity through their spatio-temporal trajectory, and synchronic identity through occupying distinct spatial locations at any given time. This makes PhysicalObject a sortal property, as instances can be individuated and tracked over time using principled criteria related to their physical continuity and spatio-temporal location.	PhysicalObject supplies its own identity condition. As a fundamental rigid property, it establishes the basic IC for physical entities through spatiotemporal continuity and material constitution. Physical objects have identity conditions based on their continuity through space and time, and their material composition (even if parts may change, the continuity of the physical entity persists). This IC is not inherited from a more general property in the domain - PhysicalObject itself is the source of identity conditions for all its subtypes (like Artifact, Organism, etc.). Any subtype of PhysicalObject will inherit or specialize this IC, but PhysicalObject itself supplies the foundational identity criterion for the physical domain.	PhysicalObject does not carry a unity condition because its instances can have vastly different mereological structures and unity criteria. Some instances may be intrinsic wholes with specific unity conditions (like a person with biological unity, or a car with functional unity), while others may be mere aggregates or scattered objects (like a pile of sand or a collection of pebbles). There is no single equivalence relation ω that makes all physical objects intrinsic wholes. While individual subtypes of PhysicalObject may carry their own specific UCs (e.g., organisms have topological/biological unity, artifacts have functional unity), the supertype itself encompasses both unified wholes and non-unified entities, thus it does not carry a common UC for all instances. This is distinct from ~U (anti-unity) because some instances ARE intrinsic wholes - just not under a common unity condition.	PhysicalObject is independent because its instances do not intrinsically require the existence of other specific entities external to themselves. A physical object exists by virtue of its own physical constitution and occupying space. While physical objects may interact with or relate to other entities, these relationships are not necessary for their existence. The entity is not externally dependent on any particular property - physical objects can exist autonomously without requiring instances of other properties (beyond their own parts/constitution) to exist.	
GroupOfPeople	http://example.org/guarino-messy#GroupOfPeople	+R	+I	+O	~U	-D	Sortal (Rigid, supplies identity)	GroupOfPeople is rigid because any entity that is a group of people is necessarily a group of people in all possible worlds where it exists. While the membership of the group may change (people can join or leave), the entity itself qua group of people cannot cease to be a group of people and remain the same entity. If all members leave and the group dissolves, it ceases to exist rather than becoming something else. The property of being a group of people is essential to its identity - it cannot lose this property and still be the same entity.	GroupOfPeople carries an identity condition. A group can be distinguished and re-identified through its membership composition (which specific people constitute the group) and potentially through organizational continuity criteria. For instance, a specific committee, team, or family can be identified synchronically by who its members are at a given time, and diachronically through membership continuity or institutional identity. Even if membership changes over time (as in organizations), there are typically conventions or formal criteria that allow us to track whether it's the same group. The property provides sufficient grounds to answer 'is this the same group?' across time and contexts, making it +I.	GroupOfPeople supplies its own identity condition. While it may inherit some general principles from broader categories, it establishes its own specific criterion for what makes one group of people the same as another group - typically based on having the same members (extensional identity) or the same organizing principle/purpose (intensional identity). This is a distinct identity condition from other sortals like Person (individual identity based on continuity of a biological organism) or Organization (which may have identity conditions based on institutional continuity that allows complete member replacement). GroupOfPeople provides a fundamental sortal-level identity criterion for collections of people, making it +O.	GroupOfPeople has anti-unity (~U) because its instances are mereological sums of people without an intrinsic unity condition. A group's parts (individual people) are not integrated through topological, morphological, or functional connection in the way required for being an intrinsic whole. The members remain distinct wholes themselves, and their collective does not form a single integrated entity with bound parts. The composition is arbitrary and changeable - people can join or leave without affecting the identity of individual members. This is a paradigmatic case of a collection or aggregate that lacks the kind of maximal self-connectedness (omega relation) required for intrinsic wholeness.	GroupOfPeople is independent (-D) because instances do not intrinsically depend on specific other entities beyond their constituent parts (the people who comprise the group). While a group requires people to exist, these people are parts/constituents of the group itself, not external entities. According to the definition, external dependence requires dependence on entities that are 'not a part nor a constituent' of the instance. Since the people forming the group are its constituent parts, GroupOfPeople does not exhibit external notional dependence and is therefore marked -D.	
LivingBeing	http://example.org/guarino-messy#LivingBeing	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Sortal (Rigid, supplies identity)	LivingBeing is a rigid property because any entity that is a living being is necessarily a living being in all possible worlds where it exists. An entity cannot be the same individual while transitioning from being a living being to a non-living being or vice versa - the cessation of life marks the end of that individual's existence as that particular entity. While a living being can die and become a corpse, the corpse is not the same entity in the strict identity sense; it is a different kind of thing (dead matter). Therefore, being a living being is an essential property that holds necessarily for all its instances throughout their existence.	LivingBeing carries an identity condition. Living beings can be distinguished and re-identified over time through biological continuity - the same organism maintains its identity through continuous metabolic processes, genetic material, and spatio-temporal continuity despite replacing parts. For example, a particular cat or tree can be tracked as the same individual organism across time through its biological integrity and continuity of life processes. This is a necessary IC (biological continuity) that allows us to say 'this is the same living being I saw yesterday' even if it has grown or changed some cells. LivingBeing is therefore a sortal property (+I).	LivingBeing supplies its own identity condition. As a fundamental biological category, it provides a global identity criterion based on biological continuity and organizational unity - the same living organism persists through time by maintaining continuous biological processes and organizational integrity, despite changing parts (cells die and are replaced). This IC is distinct from purely physical/material identity (which would be mereologically extensional) and cannot be inherited from a more general property. Subsumed properties like PERSON, ANIMAL, or PLANT may add additional identity conditions, but they inherit this basic biological IC from LivingBeing.	LivingBeing carries a unity condition as all its instances are intrinsic wholes with clear mereological structure. Living beings maintain topological and functional unity through biological integration - their parts (organs, cells, tissues) are bound together by physiological relationships and dependencies. A living being persists as an integrated organism throughout its existence, with parts that cannot be arbitrarily selected or scattered. The biological unity condition (metabolic integration, homeostatic regulation) holds essentially for any living being across its entire lifespan, making instances intrinsic wholes under a well-defined equivalence relation of biological connectivity.	LivingBeing is externally independent. While living beings require certain conditions to exist (air, nutrients, suitable environment), they do not exhibit external notional dependence on another property in the formal ontological sense. A living being's existence does not necessarily require the existence of some other distinct entity that is neither a part of it nor constitutes it. The dependencies living beings have are either on their constituent parts (organs, cells) or on environmental conditions, not on external entities in the way that PARENT depends on CHILD or STUDENT depends on SCHOOL. Living beings can exist as autonomous entities without being defined by a necessary relationship to other discrete entities.	
SocialEntity	http://example.org/guarino-messy#SocialEntity	+R	+I	+O	-U	-D	Sortal (Rigid, supplies identity)	SocialEntity is a fundamental category that defines entities constituted by social relations and collective intentionality. If something is a social entity (like an organization, institution, or social group), it is essentially so by virtue of its ontological nature - it exists through social construction and collective recognition. An entity cannot be a social entity in some possible worlds and not in others while remaining the same entity. If something loses its social nature entirely, it ceases to be that social entity and becomes a different kind of entity altogether (e.g., a physical aggregate). Unlike specific social roles (which are anti-rigid), the category SocialEntity itself represents a rigid type classification - similar to how PhysicalObject is rigid even though specific phases or roles of physical objects are not.	SocialEntity carries an identity condition. Social entities (such as organizations, institutions, groups, or social roles) have principled ways to distinguish and re-identify their instances over time. For example, a corporation can be identified by its legal registration, charter, or continuity of purpose and structure; a social group can be identified by its membership and organizational structure. While social entities may be abstract or dependent on collective intentionality, they maintain identity conditions that allow us to say 'this is the same organization/group' across time, even as membership or other attributes change. The IC may be inherited from more specific rigid properties (like Organization, Institution) that supply specific identity criteria, but SocialEntity as a category carries the capacity for identity.	SocialEntity supplies its own identity condition. Social entities (organizations, groups, institutions) have identity conditions based on their social structure, membership rules, and constitutive documents that are distinct from both physical objects and abstract entities. A company maintains identity despite complete turnover of members/employees, changes in physical assets, and even changes in purpose - its identity is tied to social-legal continuity (charter, registration, social recognition). This IC is not inherited from a more general property but is specific to the social ontological category, making SocialEntity supply its own global identity condition.	SocialEntity is a highly abstract category that encompasses diverse types of social constructs including both integrated wholes (like organizations, corporations, teams) and non-integrated aggregates (like social groups, populations, communities). While some instances may be intrinsic wholes under specific unity conditions (e.g., a corporation with functional unity through organizational structure), others are merely collections without clear mereological integration (e.g., a demographic group, an online community). There is no single equivalence relation ω that provides a common unity condition for all social entities. Therefore, SocialEntity does not carry a unity condition (+U) but its instances may vary - some being wholes and others not, making it -U rather than ~U.	SocialEntity represents a broad category encompassing socially constructed entities (organizations, institutions, groups, roles, etc.). While specific subtypes may exhibit dependence (e.g., Employee depends on Organization, Student depends on Educational Institution), the top-level category itself does not carry inherent external dependence. A SocialEntity as a general construct can exist without necessarily requiring instances of another specific entity type outside itself. The dependence property should be determined at more specific levels of the taxonomy where particular social relationships create necessary dependencies, not at this abstract foundational level.	
Location	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Location	+R	-I	-O	-U	-D	Attribution or Quality	Location is a rigid property because anything that is a location is necessarily a location in all possible worlds. A spatial region or place cannot cease to be a location while remaining the same entity - it is essential to its nature. Even if a location becomes empty or unused, it remains a location. This is similar to how a Person is necessarily a Person - the property is essential to all instances across all possible worlds.	Location does not carry an identity condition. A location is fundamentally a spatial position or region, but there is no principled way to distinguish one instance of 'location' from another over time or to determine when two locations are 'the same' location. While we can refer to locations using coordinates or descriptions (e.g., '123 Main Street'), these are external naming conventions rather than intrinsic identity conditions. The concept of location itself doesn't provide criteria for re-identification - if boundaries shift slightly, or if we're talking about a vague region, there's no clear principle for determining sameness. Location functions more as a role or relational concept (where something is) rather than a sortal that supplies identity criteria for distinguishing and tracking individual instances.	Location does not supply its own identity condition. While locations can be identified (e.g., by coordinates, addresses, or spatial boundaries), Location as a general property is too abstract to supply a specific identity criterion. More specific subtypes of Location (like GeographicalRegion, Address, SpatialPoint) would supply their own identity conditions. Additionally, since the Identity analysis determined this entity is -I (does not carry identity), it cannot be +O, as supplying an identity condition (+O) requires carrying one (+I).	Location does not carry a unity condition. While specific locations may have spatial boundaries, the property Location itself does not impose a requirement that all its instances be intrinsic wholes under a common equivalence relation ω. Locations can be continuous regions (a city), disconnected parts (an archipelago considered as one location), or arbitrary spatial designations. There is no single mereological unity condition that applies to all instances of Location - some locations may be topologically unified while others are scattered or arbitrarily bounded. The property allows for both unified and non-unified instances, thus it is -U rather than +U or ~U.	Location is independent (-D) because instances of locations can exist without depending on other entities external to them. A location exists as a spatial region or place regardless of whether anything occupies it or references it. While locations may contain objects or be related to other locations, they do not intrinsically require the existence of any external entity to exist themselves. An empty location is still a location. This contrasts with dependent entities like 'Student' which cannot exist without an educational institution, or 'Parent' which cannot exist without a child.	
Fruit	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Fruit	~R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Role or Phase (Anti-rigid)	Fruit is anti-rigid because it represents a phase or stage in the life cycle of a botanical structure. A fruit (in botanical terms) develops from a flower's ovary after fertilization and exists as a fruit only during a specific period. The same physical matter that constitutes a fruit was previously part of a flower and may later become decomposed organic matter or seeds. An entity that is a fruit at time t1 is not necessarily a fruit at all times - it contingently instantiates the property FRUIT during a particular developmental phase. Therefore, being a fruit is an optional property for all its instances, making it anti-rigid (~R).	Fruit carries an identity condition. Each fruit is a discrete physical object with spatio-temporal continuity that can be individuated and re-identified over time. A specific apple, for example, maintains its identity through time via its material constitution and spatio-temporal trajectory, even as it may ripen or decay. We can distinguish one fruit from another and track the same fruit across time, satisfying the requirements for carrying an IC. As a physical object, Fruit inherits identity conditions related to material continuity and spatio-temporal location, even if it doesn't supply its own unique IC (it would be +I but likely -O).	Fruit supplies its own identity condition as a rigid natural kind. The identity of a fruit is determined by its specific biological origin and development (which flower/ovary it developed from, its genetic makeup, its continuous developmental history from fertilization through maturation). This IC is not inherited from a more general property but is supplied by Fruit itself as a fundamental biological category. While Fruit may be subsumed by more general properties like Physical Object or Organism, the specific identity condition relevant to fruits qua fruits - tied to their botanical origin and developmental continuity - is supplied at this level. Two fruits are the same fruit if and only if they share the same botanical developmental history and physical continuity, which is a condition specific to the sortal Fruit.	A fruit is an intrinsic whole with a clear unity condition based on both topological and functional integration. Each fruit instance (an apple, an orange, a berry) maintains mereological unity through biological organization - its parts (skin, flesh, seeds, core) are topologically connected and functionally integrated as a unified botanical structure. The fruit persists as a whole throughout its existence with a stable equivalence relation binding its parts. Even when a fruit has distinct components (like segments in an orange), these parts are bound by the biological unity condition that defines the fruit as a complete organism or organ. This makes Fruit a +U property, as all its instances are intrinsic wholes under their respective unity conditions.	A fruit, once it exists as a physical object (after developing from a plant), does not intrinsically require the continued existence of other specific entities to maintain its own existence. While fruits originate from plants, once formed they can exist independently - they can be separated from the parent plant and continue to exist as distinct physical objects. The fruit's existence is not externally dependent on the plant, the tree, or any other entity in the technical sense defined (where an instance must necessarily have some other instance exist that is not a part or constituent of it). A fruit is a complete, self-sustaining physical object with its own identity criteria.	
Vertebrate	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Vertebrate	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Sortal (Rigid, supplies identity)	Vertebrate is a rigid property because having a vertebral column (backbone) is an essential biological characteristic that cannot be lost or gained by an individual organism. If an entity is a vertebrate, it is necessarily a vertebrate in all possible worlds where that entity exists - a dog cannot cease being a vertebrate while remaining the same individual organism. This is a fundamental anatomical feature that defines the entity's biological identity throughout its existence.	Vertebrate carries an identity condition. As a biological kind, vertebrates can be individuated and re-identified over time through multiple criteria: genetic makeup (DNA), biological continuity (spatio-temporal continuity of the organism), and anatomical structure (presence of a vertebral column in the same organism). Each individual vertebrate maintains its identity through time despite changes in properties - a vertebrate that grows, molts, or changes location remains the same individual vertebrate. This IC is inherited from more general biological sortals like ORGANISM or ANIMAL, which supply identity conditions based on biological continuity and genetic constitution.	Vertebrate supplies its own identity condition based on having a specific vertebral column/spinal structure. While it is a biological kind like Animal, it provides a more specific structural criterion for identity - the presence and configuration of vertebrae forming the backbone. This is a rigid property that supplies a necessary condition for being the same vertebrate across time (maintaining the same vertebral structure/nervous system organization), rather than merely inheriting a general biological identity condition. The vertebrate identity is tied to this specific anatomical feature that distinguishes it from other animals and provides its own basis for individuation.	Vertebrate carries a unity condition. All instances of Vertebrate are biological organisms with integrated anatomical structures centered around the vertebral column (backbone). Each vertebrate is an intrinsic whole under a biological/topological unity condition - their parts (organs, skeletal structure, nervous system) are functionally and spatially connected throughout their existence. The vertebral column itself provides a structural principle of integration, and all vertebrates maintain mereological integrity as living organisms with clear boundaries and internal organization. This satisfies Definition 11, as there exists an equivalence relation (biological connectivity/functional integration) such that all instances are intrinsic wholes under this relation throughout their existence.	Vertebrate is independent (-D) because individual vertebrates can exist without necessarily requiring the existence of other entities that are not their parts or constituents. While vertebrates may have ecological relationships (predator-prey, symbiosis) or biological dependencies (parents for reproduction), these are not intrinsic existential dependencies in the ontological sense. A vertebrate exists as a complete organism with its backbone (part) and body (constitution) without requiring external entities to maintain its existence. The definition of external dependence requires that an instance necessarily depends on some other instance that is neither a part nor constituent - vertebrates do not meet this criterion.	
Caterpillar	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Caterpillar	~R	+I	-O	+U	-D	Role or Phase (Anti-rigid)	Caterpillar is anti-rigid because it represents a temporary phase in the life cycle of certain organisms (butterflies and moths). Every instance of a caterpillar is necessarily not always a caterpillar - it will undergo metamorphosis to become a butterfly or moth. No caterpillar can remain a caterpillar in all possible worlds while maintaining its identity as the same organism. This is a paradigmatic example of a phase sortal: all instances must eventually cease to be caterpillars while continuing to exist as the same individual in a different life stage.	Caterpillar carries an identity condition. As a biological organism (larval stage of a butterfly/moth), each caterpillar instance can be distinguished and re-identified over time through biological identity criteria such as continuous spatio-temporal existence, genetic identity (DNA), and physical continuity. Individual caterpillars maintain their identity throughout their larval development despite changes in size and appearance. The identity condition is inherited from superordinate properties like ORGANISM or LIVING THING, which supply biological identity criteria that allow us to track the same caterpillar across time and distinguish it from other caterpillars.	Caterpillar is the larval stage of butterflies and moths. While it carries an identity condition (+I) inherited from broader biological entities, it does not supply its own identity condition. The identity of a caterpillar is grounded in the identity of the underlying organism (the insect) that persists through metamorphosis from caterpillar to butterfly/moth. The property CATERPILLAR is phase-dependent and non-rigid - the same organism exists before and after being a caterpillar. Therefore, the identity condition is supplied by a more fundamental rigid property like INSECT or ORGANISM, not by CATERPILLAR itself.	A caterpillar is a living organism with a highly integrated biological structure. Its parts (segments, organs, nervous system, digestive tract, etc.) are functionally and topologically connected, forming a unified whole with clear boundaries. Each caterpillar maintains this unity condition throughout its existence as a caterpillar (until metamorphosis). The parts are not arbitrary but constitute an intrinsic whole under biological/functional unity - the organism functions as an integrated system where parts work together for survival and growth. This satisfies Definition 10 as an intrinsic whole under a biological unity relation.	A caterpillar is an independent biological organism that exists as a self-contained entity. While it depends on environmental resources like food and habitat (as all living things do), it does not have an essential external notional dependence on another entity that must exist outside of itself. The caterpillar's existence is not inherently tied to the existence of some other specific entity beyond its own parts and constitution. It is a complete organism in its larval stage, not requiring another entity (like how PARENT requires CHILD) to exist as a caterpillar.	
Person	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Person	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Sortal (Rigid, supplies identity)	Person is a rigid property because if something is a person, it is necessarily a person in all possible worlds where it exists. An entity cannot cease to be a person while remaining the same individual - personhood is an essential characteristic that holds necessarily for all its instances. This is a paradigmatic example of rigidity, as mentioned in the background text itself.	PERSON is a canonical example of a property that carries an identity condition. Instances of PERSON can be distinguished and re-identified through various identity criteria such as DNA, fingerprints, social security numbers, or spatio-temporal continuity of a human body. As mentioned in the background text, PERSON carries identity conditions like 'having-the-same-SSN' or 'having-the-same-fingerprints' that satisfy the identity formula. Additionally, PERSON is a rigid property (something cannot be a person at one time and not a person at another while remaining the same entity), which allows it to supply (not just carry) an identity condition. This makes PERSON a sortal - a property that provides principled criteria for individuating and re-identifying its instances across time.	Person is a rigid property that supplies its own identity condition. It provides a global, necessary and sufficient condition for identity (e.g., having the same DNA, fingerprints, or SSN) that distinguishes one person from another across time. As a fundamental sortal, Person does not inherit its identity condition from a more general property - it establishes the criteria for what makes the same person at different times. Properties like Student, Employee, or Child would inherit their identity conditions from Person, but Person itself supplies the foundational IC for personal identity.	Person carries a unity condition (+U) because all instances are intrinsic wholes with a clear biological unity condition. Each person maintains topological and functional unity throughout their existence - all parts of a person are connected through biological systems (circulatory, nervous, etc.) and nothing else satisfies this same connection relation with those parts. A person's bodily parts are maximally self-connected under the biological organism unity condition (omega), and this unity persists necessarily throughout the person's existence. This makes Person a paradigmatic example of a property carrying unity, as persons are integrated biological wholes rather than arbitrary aggregates.	Person is externally independent. While persons require various things to exist (oxygen, food, etc.), these are not external dependencies in the ontological sense defined here. A person does not necessarily require the existence of another distinct entity (that is not a part or constituent of them) to exist. Unlike PARENT which requires CHILD, or STUDENT which requires EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION, a person can exist as an individual without necessarily requiring any specific other entity external to themselves. The dependencies persons have (like needing a body or biological parts) are internal - these are parts or constituents of the person, not external entities.	
LegalAgent	http://example.org/guarino-messy#LegalAgent	~R	+I	+O	-U	-D	Role or Phase (Anti-rigid)	LegalAgent is anti-rigid because it represents a role or status that entities acquire contingently through legal recognition. An entity (whether a person or organization) can gain legal agency status (e.g., when a person reaches legal age of majority, or when a corporation is officially registered) and can lose it (e.g., through legal incapacitation, dissolution of a corporation, or death). No entity is necessarily a legal agent in all possible worlds - it is an acquired, contingent status dependent on legal frameworks and conditions. All instances of LegalAgent could possibly not be legal agents, making it anti-rigid rather than merely non-rigid.	LegalAgent carries an identity condition. Legal agents (whether persons or organizations) must be uniquely identifiable within legal systems for accountability, rights, and obligations. They are assigned persistent legal identifiers (e.g., social security numbers for individuals, registration numbers for corporations) and have principled criteria for re-identification across time. A legal agent at time t1 can be recognized as the same legal agent at time t2 through legal documentation, registration status, and continuity of legal personality. This satisfies the sortal requirement that instances can be distinguished and tracked diachronically.	LegalAgent supplies its own identity condition. As a fundamental legal concept, it establishes identity based on legal recognition and standing - entities are the same legal agent if they have the same legal personality/status under law. This is distinct from physical identity (for persons) or organizational identity (for corporations). LegalAgent is a rigid property that provides its own criterion: legal agents are identical if and only if they possess the same legal personhood. This IC is not inherited from a more general property but is intrinsic to the legal domain, making LegalAgent +O.	LegalAgent does not carry a common unity condition for all its instances. While all instances are intrinsic wholes (persons have biological unity, organizations have functional/legal unity), there is no single equivalence relation omega that unifies all legal agents. Natural persons maintain unity through biological integration, while legal persons (corporations, partnerships) maintain unity through legal and functional relations. Since different subkinds of LegalAgent have incompatible unity conditions, LegalAgent itself does not satisfy Definition 11 which requires 'there exists an equivalence relation omega such that all its instances are intrinsic wholes under omega.' This is explicitly mentioned in the background text as an example: 'Legal Agent, all of whose instances are intrinsic wholes (some people, some companies), however there is not a single relation omega for all of them.'	LegalAgent represents entities that can bear legal rights and obligations (persons, organizations, etc.). While legal agents exist within legal systems and their legal status depends on legal frameworks, the entities themselves (the persons or organizations) do not intrinsically depend on other specific entities for their existence. A person exists as a physical being independent of being recognized as a legal agent, and an organization can exist as a collective independent of other specific entities. The legal agency is a status or capability, not an existential dependence. Therefore, LegalAgent is marked as -D (independent).	
Entity	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Entity	+R	+I	+O	-U	-D	Sortal (Rigid, supplies identity)	Entity is the most general ontological category - anything that exists is necessarily an entity. If something is an entity (i.e., it exists), it cannot cease to be an entity while continuing to exist. There is no possible world where something that is an entity could exist but not be an entity. This makes Entity a rigid property that necessarily holds for all its instances across all possible worlds.	Entity is a rigid property that serves as the top-level sortal in ontological hierarchies. It carries an identity condition because every entity must be distinguishable and re-identifiable across time - this is the fundamental requirement of existence itself. The identity condition for Entity would be based on spatio-temporal continuity or some form of principled individuation that allows us to say 'this entity at time t1 is the same as that entity at time t2'. While Entity may not supply a specific IC (that role is left to more specialized properties), it certainly carries one, as per the Sortal Individuation assumption that 'every domain element must instantiate some property carrying an IC'. Entity being the most general property that everything instantiates, must itself carry an IC to satisfy Quine's dictum 'No entity without identity'.	Entity is the most fundamental, top-level property in any ontology. It cannot inherit an identity condition from any more general property (since there is none more general). Therefore, Entity must supply its own identity condition - typically based on numerical identity or spatio-temporal coincidence. As the ultimate rigid property that subsumes all domain elements, Entity provides the foundational IC that all other properties either inherit or specialize.	Entity is the most general category encompassing everything that exists. Its instances include wholes (like persons, cars), non-wholes (like amounts of matter, scattered objects), and aggregates (like collections). Since Entity subsumes properties with incompatible unity conditions (+U, -U, and ~U), it cannot itself carry a unity condition. There is no single equivalence relation omega under which all entities are intrinsic wholes. Therefore, Entity is -U (non-unifying) - it does not carry a unity condition, though some of its instances may be wholes under their more specific properties.	Entity is the most fundamental and general category in any ontology, representing anything that exists or can be conceived of. By its nature as the top-level universal, Entity does not intrinsically depend on any other entities for its existence. All other categories are specializations of Entity, but Entity itself stands as the maximally independent category. Instances of Entity (which encompasses everything that exists) do not require the existence of other external entities as a necessary condition for their being. Entity provides the foundation upon which all other categories are built, making it necessarily independent (-D).	
Organization	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Organization	+R	+I	+O	-U	-D	Sortal (Rigid, supplies identity)	Organization is a rigid property because anything that is an organization is necessarily an organization in all possible worlds where it exists. An organization cannot cease to be an organization and remain the same entity - if it dissolves or fundamentally changes its nature, it ceases to exist as that organization. While organizations can change their members, structure, or activities, these changes occur within the essential nature of being an organization. An entity cannot be 'temporarily' an organization in the way a person can be temporarily a student. The property of being an organization is essential to the identity of any instance throughout its existence.	Organization carries an identity condition. Organizations can be distinguished and re-identified over time through criteria such as legal registration numbers, founding documents, continuity of purpose and structure, and social/legal recognition. An organization maintains its identity even as its members change (complete turnover of employees doesn't make it a different organization), and we can track the same organization diachronically (e.g., IBM in 1950 is the same organization as IBM today despite changes in personnel, location, and even business focus). The IC might include criteria like: having the same legal charter, maintaining institutional continuity, or preserving organizational identity through succession rules. This allows us to distinguish Organization A from Organization B and re-identify the same organization across time.	Organization supplies its own identity condition. As a rigid sortal, it establishes the global identity criteria for organizational entities - such as continuity of legal structure, mission, and institutional identity - that persist even when members, locations, or activities change. This is distinct from and not inherited from more general properties. An organization maintains identity through time independent of physical composition (unlike Physical Object) and through criteria specific to institutional/collective entities.	Organization does not carry a common unity condition for all its instances. While individual organizations (a specific company, a particular NGO) are intrinsic wholes with functional unity based on organizational structure and purpose, there is no single equivalence relation omega that applies uniformly to all organizations. Different types of organizations have different unity conditions: a corporation has different structural integration than a club or a committee. Additionally, organizations can exist as single legal entities or as loose confederations. Some instances may be tightly integrated wholes while others may be loosely structured federations. Therefore, Organization does not satisfy Definition 11's requirement of a single equivalence relation omega for all instances, making it -U rather than +U. It is not ~U because individual organizations are intrinsic wholes, just not under a common UC.	Organization is externally independent. While an organization requires members (people) to exist, these members are constituent parts of the organization itself, not external entities. According to the definition, external dependence requires that the dependent entity necessarily requires some instance of another property that is 'not a part nor a constituent' of it. Since members constitute the organization (they are its parts), Organization does not exhibit external notional dependence on any property. An organization can exist as a complete entity with its constituent members without depending on external entities.	
Agent	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Agent	~R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Role or Phase (Anti-rigid)	Agent is anti-rigid because it represents a role or capacity that entities possess contingently. An entity can be an agent in some possible worlds (when performing actions or having agency) and not be an agent in others (when not acting or lacking agency). For example, a person is necessarily a person (+R), but that same person is only contingently an agent - they are an agent when they act, but the property of being an agent is not essential to their identity. All instances of Agent could possibly not be agents, making this an anti-rigid property typical of roles.	Agent carries an identity condition. Agents are entities capable of acting, and each agent instance can be distinguished and re-identified over time through its continuous causal history, behavioral patterns, and capacity for autonomous action. Whether the agent is a person, organization, or artificial system, there exists a principled way to track the same agent across time through its persistent identity as an acting entity. The identity condition is grounded in the agent's continuous existence as a unified actor with agency, making it possible to distinguish one agent from another and recognize the same agent at different times.	Agent supplies its own identity condition. As a rigid property that defines entities capable of acting and bearing responsibility, Agent establishes fundamental identity criteria based on continuity of agency, action-bearing capacity, and the persistence of the entity as a locus of intentional behavior. Unlike more specific properties like 'Person' or 'Organization' that might refine these conditions, Agent provides the foundational identity condition for all entities that can act—namely, that the same agent is one that maintains continuity as a subject of actions across time. This is a global identity condition that Agent supplies rather than merely inheriting from a more general property.	Agent carries a unity condition (+U) because all instances of agents must be intrinsic wholes under some equivalence relation. Agents, whether persons (biological unity), organizations (functional unity), or AI systems (computational unity), must maintain integrated, self-connected structures to exhibit agency. An agent cannot be a scattered, arbitrary collection of parts - it requires coordinated parts working together to perceive, decide, and act. While different types of agents may have different unity conditions (persons have biological/topological unity, organizations have functional unity), each agent instance is necessarily an intrinsic whole throughout its existence. The capacity for autonomous action and goal-directed behavior inherently requires mereological integration, making Agent a +U property.	An Agent is independent because instances of Agent can exist without intrinsically depending on other specific entities external to themselves. While agents may interact with, act upon, or relate to other entities in their environment, they do not require the necessary existence of any particular external entity (that is not a part or constituent of themselves) to exist as agents. The capacity for agency - the ability to act, make decisions, or exert influence - is an intrinsic property that does not create existential dependence on external entities. Unlike roles such as PARENT (which depends on CHILD) or STUDENT (which depends on SCHOOL), being an agent does not necessitate the existence of any specific external entity.	
Apple	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Apple	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Sortal (Rigid, supplies identity)	Apple is a rigid property because anything that is an apple is necessarily an apple in all possible worlds. An apple cannot cease to be an apple while remaining the same individual - it can rot, be eaten, or decompose, but these represent destruction of the entity rather than a change in its essential nature. The property of being an apple is a sortal property that provides identity criteria for its instances throughout their existence. An apple doesn't 'stop being an apple' and become something else; rather, the apple ceases to exist as a coherent entity.	Apple carries an identity condition. As a physical object and natural kind, individual apples can be distinguished and re-identified through spatio-temporal continuity and physical constitution. Each apple instance maintains identity over time through continuous existence in space-time, even as it undergoes changes (ripening, decay). We can distinguish one apple from another and track the same apple across different times through its spatio-temporal trajectory and physical persistence, making it a sortal property.	Apple, as a natural kind referring to individual fruit instances, supplies its own identity condition. Each apple has spatial-temporal continuity and mereological identity conditions that distinguish it from other apples - same matter composition, same spatial location over time, same physical boundaries. While it may inherit broader identity principles from PHYSICAL OBJECT or FRUIT, Apple as a basic-level natural kind establishes its own specific identity criteria for what makes one apple the same apple over time (e.g., continuous physical structure, biological integrity). This is distinct from just carrying an inherited IC - Apple supplies the sortal level at which we individuate and count these particular entities.	An apple is an intrinsic whole with clear mereological structure where all parts (skin, flesh, core, seeds) are topologically and functionally connected through a biological unity condition. The parts form an integrated biological organism (or fruit of an organism) with maximal self-connectedness. An apple maintains this unity condition throughout its existence as an apple - if it is divided or its parts are separated significantly, it ceases to be an apple and becomes apple parts or pieces. This satisfies Definition 11: there exists an equivalence relation (biological/topological connection) under which all instances of Apple are intrinsic wholes.	An apple is a physical fruit object that exists independently once it has formed. While it originates from an apple tree, once the apple exists as a discrete entity, it does not require the continued existence of any other specific external entity to maintain its own existence. The apple has its own independent existence as a physical object, with its parts (skin, flesh, seeds) being constituents of the apple itself rather than external dependencies. Therefore, Apple carries the -D meta-property indicating independence.
