Agent	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Agent	~R	-I	-O	-U	+D	Formal Role	Agent is anti-rigid (~R) because being an agent is not essential - an entity is only an agent while involved in action/agency relationships. It does not carry identity (-I, -O) as it's a role that entities play rather than supplying conditions for their identity. It lacks unity (-U) as diverse kinds of entities (persons, organizations, software) can be agents without sharing a common unity criterion. It is dependent (+D) because being an agent requires the existence of actions, contexts, or relationships in which agency is exercised. This matches the paper's example treating Agent as anti-rigid to capture that something is an agent only while involved in action. As a non-sortal (~R, +D, -I), it classifies as a Formal Role - a top-level role property that doesn't carry identity and serves as a basis for more specific material roles.	
AmountOfMatter	http://example.org/guarino-messy#AmountOfMatter	+R	+I	+O	~U	-D	Type	AmountOfMatter is rigid (+R) because something that is an amount of matter is necessarily so in all possible worlds - it cannot cease to be an amount of matter while remaining the same entity. It carries identity (+I) and supplies its own identity condition (+O) based on mereological extensionality: two amounts of matter are identical iff they have the same parts. This is explicitly discussed in the paper as an example where 'mereological extensionality' applies. It has anti-unity (~U) because amounts of matter are not intrinsic wholes - they are arbitrary aggregations without a unifying relation that binds their parts together (the paper states 'we assume that none of them has a unity condition, thus ~U'). It is independent (-D) as amounts of matter do not depend on external entities for their existence. The combination +R, +I, +O makes it a Type - a rigid property that supplies its own identity condition, forming part of the backbone taxonomy.	
Animal	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Animal	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Type	ANIMAL is a rigid property (+R) because anything that is an animal is necessarily an animal in all possible worlds where it exists - an animal cannot cease to be an animal while remaining the same entity. It supplies its own identity condition (+O) through biological criteria (e.g., genetic makeup, continuous biological development from conception), making it also carry identity (+I). Instances of ANIMAL are intrinsic wholes (+U) with biological unity - they have functionally and topologically unified parts that constitute a living organism. Animals are independent entities (-D) that do not externally depend on other entities for their existence (though they may depend on parts like organs, these are internal constituents, not external dependencies). As a property that is rigid, supplies its own identity, and represents a natural kind, ANIMAL classifies as a Type - one of the fundamental categories for organizing domain entities.	
Apple	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Apple	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Type	APPLE is a rigid natural kind - an entity that is an apple is necessarily an apple in all possible worlds where it exists (cannot cease being an apple while remaining the same entity). It supplies its own identity condition based on biological continuity and genetic/developmental criteria (what makes this apple the same apple over time). Apples are intrinsic wholes with clear topological and functional unity - they have definite boundaries determined by their biological structure. They are independent entities that can exist without necessarily depending on external entities (though they may be constitutionally dependent on their matter, they are not externally dependent in the relevant sense). As a rigid property that supplies identity (+O implies +I and +R), APPLE qualifies as a Type - the fundamental kind of sortal property in the ontology.	
Butterfly	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Butterfly	~R	+I	-O	+U	-D	Phased Sortal	Butterfly is a temporal phase in the life cycle of a lepidopteran insect. It is anti-rigid (~R) because an individual lepidopteran is not necessarily a butterfly throughout its existence—it begins as a caterpillar and later metamorphoses into a butterfly. The property carries identity (+I) because butterflies can be individuated and reidentified, but it does not supply its own identity condition (-O); instead, it inherits identity from the superordinate type LEPIDOPTERAN, which provides the global identity criterion across life phases. Butterflies have unity (+U) as they are biological organisms that constitute intrinsic wholes with morphological and functional integration. They are independent (-D) as individual butterflies do not require external entities beyond their parts to exist. This combination (~R, +I, -O, +U, -D) characterizes Butterfly as a Phased Sortal—a property representing a specific temporal phase of an entity that maintains identity through transformation, as explicitly discussed in the paper's taxonomy cleaning example.	
Caterpillar	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Caterpillar	~R	+I	-O	+U	-D	Phased Sortal	CATERPILLAR is anti-rigid (~R) because an individual caterpillar does not necessarily remain a caterpillar - it transforms into a butterfly while remaining the same organism. It carries identity (+I) inherited from a superordinate type (LEPIDOPTERAN), but does not supply its own global identity condition (-O) since the same individual exists as both caterpillar and butterfly phases. The paper explicitly uses this as the canonical example of a phased sortal: 'an individual may at one time be a CATERPILLAR and at another time be a BUTTERFLY... phased sortals must be subsumed by a type.' CATERPILLAR instances are intrinsic wholes (+U) as individual organisms with functional unity. They are not externally dependent (-D) as they exist as complete organisms without requiring other entities beyond their parts. As a phased sortal, CATERPILLAR represents a temporal phase with local identity conditions that change across the lifecycle, while global identity is maintained by the type LEPIDOPTERAN.	
Country	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Country	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Type	Following the paper's analysis in the taxonomy cleaning example, COUNTRY (when properly distinguished from geographical regions) is a rigid sortal that supplies its own identity condition. The paper explicitly states that countries 'carry their own identity and unity' after splitting the concept from GEOGRAPHICAL REGION. As a Type, COUNTRY is +R (a country is necessarily a country while it exists as such entity), +I (carries identity), +O (supplies its own identity distinct from mere geographical regions), +U (has political/social unity as an organized entity), and -D (can exist independently as a sovereign entity). The paper classifies COUNTRY under SOCIAL ENTITY and LEGAL ENTITY in the cleaned taxonomy, treating it as a type-level concept with its own identity conditions related to political organization rather than mere spatial location.	
Entity	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Entity	+R	-I	-O	-U	-D	Category	Entity is the most abstract, top-level ontological property. It is rigid (+R) because anything that is an entity is necessarily an entity in all possible worlds - there is no possible world where an entity exists but is not an entity. However, Entity does not carry identity conditions (-I, -O) because it is too general to provide criteria for distinguishing one entity from another or for re-identifying entities across time - identity conditions are supplied by more specific sortals like PERSON or PHYSICAL OBJECT. Entity does not impose unity constraints (-U) as entities can be wholes, parts, or collections. It is independent (-D) as it represents the broadest existential category. As a rigid property without identity conditions, Entity is classified as a Category - the highest-level rigid property that carves the domain into useful segments but does not provide identity criteria.	
Food	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Food	~R	+I	-O	-U	+D	Material Role	FOOD is anti-rigid (~R) because something is food only contingently - an apple can cease to be food (e.g., when it rots and becomes inedible) while remaining the same physical object. It carries identity (+I) because food items inherit identity conditions from their underlying types (e.g., a particular apple as food inherits the identity of that apple as a physical object). However, it does not supply its own identity (-O) since 'being food' doesn't provide a new global identity criterion - the identity comes from what the food *is* (apple, bread, etc.). Food instances don't necessarily have a common unity condition (-U) as food can be discrete objects (an apple) or aggregates (a bowl of rice). Food is dependent (+D) because something becomes food only in relation to potential consumers and their needs - food exists as a role in an event or relationship (consumption). This matches the paper's example of FOOD as a material role that 'normally specialize formal roles and have specific meaning in a domain.'	
Fruit	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Fruit	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Type	FRUIT is rigid (+R) because once something is a fruit (the botanical structure developed from a flower's ovary), it remains necessarily a fruit throughout its existence - a fruit cannot cease to be a fruit while continuing to exist as the same entity. It carries and supplies its own identity condition (+I, +O) based on biological origin and developmental structure - what makes one fruit distinct from another is determined by its development from a specific flower and containing specific seeds/reproductive material. It has unity (+U) as fruits are intrinsic wholes with topological and functional unity - the parts (skin, flesh, seeds) are bound together as a functional botanical structure. It is independent (-D) as fruits can exist without necessarily requiring other specific entities (though they depend on the plant that produced them, once formed they exist as independent objects). As a rigid property that supplies its own identity (+O, +R), FRUIT qualifies as a Type - the fundamental kind of entity in ontological classification.	
Group	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Group	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Type	GROUP is analyzed as a rigid property (+R) because an entity that is a group remains a group in all possible worlds where it exists - it cannot cease to be a group and remain the same entity. It supplies its own identity condition (+O, which implies +I) based on which members constitute the group and the organizational structure binding them together. GROUP carries unity (+U) because instances are intrinsic wholes - a group has a unifying relation (typically functional or organizational) that binds its members together and distinguishes them from arbitrary collections. This is similar to how ORGANIZATION was treated in the paper's example. GROUP is independent (-D) as groups can exist without depending on other entities beyond their members (which are parts/constituents, not external dependencies). As a rigid property that supplies its own identity, GROUP is classified as a Type - one of the fundamental sortals in an ontology that provides the backbone taxonomy structure.	
GroupOfPeople	http://example.org/guarino-messy#GroupOfPeople	+R	+I	+O	-U	-D	Type	GroupOfPeople is rigid (+R) because any instance that is a group of people remains a group of people in all possible worlds where it exists - the same collection cannot cease to be a group of people while continuing to exist as that same entity. It carries identity (+I) and supplies its own identity condition (+O) based on the collective membership - two groups are the same if they have the same members. However, it lacks a common unity condition (-U) because groups can vary in their internal organization and cohesion (a crowd vs. an organized team have different unifying relations, yet both are groups of people). It is independent (-D) as groups can exist without depending on external entities beyond their constituent members (who are parts/constituents, not external). As a rigid property that supplies its own identity, GroupOfPeople qualifies as a Type in the ontological taxonomy.	
LegalAgent	http://example.org/guarino-messy#LegalAgent	~R	-I	-O	-U	+D	Formal Role	LegalAgent is anti-rigid (~R) because an entity is a legal agent only while involved in legal contracts or relationships - the same entity (person, organization) can exist without being a legal agent. It does not carry identity (-I, -O) as it represents a relational status rather than supplying identity conditions - the identity comes from the underlying entity (PERSON, ORGANIZATION). It is dependent (+D) because being a legal agent requires external legal relationships or contracts to exist. It does not impose a common unity condition (-U) across all instances, as legal agents can be persons, organizations, or countries with different unity criteria. As a formal role (~R, +D, -I), LegalAgent sits at the top of role hierarchies and can be specialized by material roles like specific legal statuses.	
LivingBeing	http://example.org/guarino-messy#LivingBeing	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Type	LivingBeing is a rigid property (+R) because anything that is a living being is necessarily so across all possible worlds - if something ceases to be a living being (dies), it becomes a different kind of entity (a corpse, remains). It supplies its own identity condition (+O, thus +I) based on biological continuity and life processes - we can distinguish one living being from another through their individual biological organization and life history. Living beings have unity (+U) as they are intrinsic wholes with biological organization binding their parts together functionally. They are independent (-D) as they can exist without necessarily depending on other specific entities (though they may need environmental conditions, no external dependence on another particular entity is essential to their identity). This makes LivingBeing a Type - a rigid property that supplies its own identity, representing a fundamental kind in the domain of biological entities.	
Location	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Location	+R	-I	-O	-U	-D	Category	Location is a rigid property because anything that is a location is necessarily a location in all possible worlds (spatial or temporal regions don't cease being locations). However, Location does not supply identity conditions - we cannot determine when two locations are the same location through Location itself, as this depends on the specific nature of the location (spatial region, temporal region, etc.). The paper explicitly mentions 'LOCATION' as an example of a Category. Location does not impose unity conditions since locations can be either connected or disconnected (as stated in the paper's example). Location is independent (-D) as spatial/temporal regions don't intrinsically depend on other entities to exist. As a Category, it serves as a high-level rigid property that carves the domain into useful segments but carries no identity conditions.	
Organization	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Organization	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Type	ORGANIZATION is rigid (+R) because an entity that is an organization remains an organization in all possible worlds where it exists - an organization cannot cease being an organization while continuing to exist as the same entity. It carries and supplies its own identity condition (+I, +O) - organizations can be identified through criteria like registration numbers, founding documents, or legal status, distinct from the identity of their members. An organization has unity (+U) as it constitutes an intrinsic whole bound by organizational structure and purpose, not merely a collection of people. While organizations depend on members to function, they are ontologically independent (-D) in the sense that the specific individuals can change while the organization persists - the organization is not externally dependent on any particular entity outside itself. As a rigid property supplying its own identity, ORGANIZATION qualifies as a Type.	
Person	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Person	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Type	PERSON is a paradigmatic example of a Type. It is rigid (+R) because if x is a person, x must be a person in every possible world where x exists - one cannot cease being a person while remaining the same entity. It supplies its own identity condition (+O) through criteria like having the same fingerprints or SSN, making it also carry identity (+I). PERSON exhibits unity (+U) as each person is an intrinsic whole with topological, morphological, and functional coherence. It is independent (-D) as persons do not require external entities to exist (unlike roles such as PARENT which depend on CHILD). As a Type, PERSON is a fundamental sortal that supplies identity and serves as the backbone of an ontology, with all its instances necessarily instantiating this property throughout their existence.	
PhysicalObject	http://example.org/guarino-messy#PhysicalObject	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Type	PhysicalObject is a rigid property (+R) because anything that is a physical object is necessarily so across all possible worlds - it cannot cease being a physical object while remaining the same entity. It carries identity (+I) and supplies its own identity condition (+O) based on spatio-temporal continuity and material constitution. As stated in the paper, 'Physical objects are taken to be isolated material entities' - they are intrinsic wholes with topological unity (+U), distinguishing them from mere amounts of matter or arbitrary collections. Physical objects are independent (-D) as they do not require external entities for their existence (unlike roles such as PARENT). As a rigid property that supplies its own identity, PhysicalObject qualifies as a Type - one of the fundamental categories in the ontology that forms the backbone taxonomy.	
Red	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Red	~R	-I	-O	-U	+D	Attribution	RED is a paradigmatic example of an attribution property. It is anti-rigid (~R) because entities can change color - something can be red at one time and not red at another while remaining the same entity. It does not carry identity (-I, -O) because 'being red' does not provide criteria for distinguishing or re-identifying individuals across time or worlds. It does not impose unity conditions (-U) as redness can apply to wholes, parts, or aggregates indiscriminately. It is dependent (+D) because red exists as a property of colored objects - there must be something that is red. RED represents a value of an attribute (COLOR) and fits the paper's explicit characterization: 'Attributions...are non-sortal properties that are non-rigid...intuitively represents values of attributes like COLOR-OF...Examples are RED or MALE.'	
RedApple	http://example.org/guarino-messy#RedApple	~R	+I	-O	+U	-D	Phased Sortal	RedApple is anti-rigid (~R) because an apple can change color (from green to red, or red to brown) while remaining the same apple - being red is not essential throughout its existence. It carries identity (+I) inherited from its subsuming type APPLE, which supplies the identity conditions for individuating apples. However, RedApple does not supply its own identity (-O) since the identity of a red apple is determined by it being an apple, not by its redness. It has unity (+U) as each red apple is an intrinsic whole with topological and functional unity. It is independent (-D) as red apples do not depend on external entities for their existence (the color red is an attribution/quality of the apple itself). This classification as a Phased Sortal captures that RedApple represents a temporal phase of an apple's existence - the phase when it exhibits the red color - while the same individual apple persists through color changes according to the global IC supplied by APPLE.	
SocialEntity	http://example.org/guarino-messy#SocialEntity	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Type	SocialEntity is rigid (+R) because an entity that is fundamentally a social entity (like an organization, institution, or social group) remains so necessarily - it cannot cease being a social entity while continuing to exist as the same entity. It supplies its own identity (+O, thus +I) as social entities have distinct identity conditions based on their social constitution and purpose, separate from the physical entities that may compose them. For example, an organization maintains its identity even as its members change. It carries unity (+U) as social entities are conceived as unified wholes with internal social structure and cohesion that binds their constituents together. Social entities are independent (-D) in the sense that while they are composed of individuals, the social entity itself is not externally dependent on any particular individual outside its constitution. As a rigid property that supplies identity, SocialEntity qualifies as a Type in the ontological framework.	
Vertebrate	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Vertebrate	+R	+I	-O	+U	-D	Quasi-Type	Vertebrate is a rigid property (+R) because an organism that is a vertebrate cannot cease to be one while remaining the same organism - it's an essential biological classification. It carries identity (+I) as it must be subsumed by a biological type (e.g., ANIMAL) that supplies identity conditions. However, it does not supply its own identity condition (-O), instead inheriting it from its superordinate type. The paper explicitly mentions 'VERTEBRATE-ANIMAL' as an example of a quasi-type. Vertebrates have unity (+U) as they are complete organisms with intrinsic wholeness defined by their biological structure. They are independent (-D) as they don't existentially depend on external entities for their existence (they may have constituent parts, but those are internal, not external dependencies).
