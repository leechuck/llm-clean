Agent	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Agent	~R	+I	-O	+U	+D	Role	The term 'Agent' is anti-rigid (~R) because an entity can stop being an agent without losing its identity. It carries an identity condition (+I) inherited from its base type (e.g., Person or Organization) but does not supply its own (+O). It is unifying (+U) as it refers to discrete wholes, and it is dependent (+D) because the status of agency requires a relationship to an action, process, or principal.	
AmountOfMatter	http://example.org/guarino-messy#AmountOfMatter	+R	-I	-O	~U	-D	Mass Noun / Non-sortal	AmountOfMatter is Rigid because an instance cannot cease to be an amount of matter without ceasing to exist. It is -I and -O because it lacks a global identity condition for its parts (no 'one matter' or 'same matter' without external boundaries). It is ~U (Anti-Unity) because it is divisible and any part of it is also matter, making it a mereological sum rather than a unified whole.	
Animal	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Animal	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Type	Animal is a Rigid property because an instance cannot cease to be an animal without ceasing to exist. It supplies its own Identity Condition (+O) to distinguish one animal instance from another and carries it (+I). It has Unity (+U) because animals are discrete biological wholes, and it is Independent (-D) as its existence does not intrinsically require the existence of another specific entity.	
Apple	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Apple	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Type / Substance Sortal	Apple is a rigid property because an instance of an apple cannot cease to be an apple without losing its identity. It supplies its own identity conditions (supplied by its biological/physical nature as a fruit) and provides a principle for determining unity (the physical boundary of the fruit as a whole). It is an independent substance sortal.	
Butterfly	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Butterfly	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Type / Substance Sortal	Butterfly is Rigid (+R) because if an instance ceases to be a butterfly, it ceases to exist as that entity. It supplies its own Identity Condition (+O, +I) to distinguish one butterfly from another. It is Unifying (+U) because a butterfly is a discrete organic whole with defined boundaries. It is Independent (-D) because its existence does not inherently require the existence of another specific individual entity in the way a role like 'Student' does.	
Caterpillar	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Caterpillar	~R	+I	-O	+U	-D	Phase	The term represents a specific life cycle stage (Phase). It is anti-rigid (~R) because an instance ceases to be a caterpillar (becoming a butterfly) while maintaining its identity as the same organism. It carries identity (+I) inherited from the 'Butterfly' or 'Insect' kind but does not supply its own global IC (-O). It is a whole (+U) and exists independently of other distinct individuals (-D).	
Country	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Country	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Type (Sortal)	A Country is a Rigid property (+R) because a country cannot cease to be a country without ceasing to exist as that entity. It supplies its own Identity Condition (+O, implying +I) based on defined borders and constitutional continuity. It defines a whole with Unity (+U) as it is not a mere sum of parts, and while it interacts with others, it is considered an independent entity (-D) in this framework.	
Entity	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Entity	+R	-I	-O	-U	-D	Non-Sortal Mixin	The term 'Entity' is a top-level category. It is Rigid because an entity cannot cease to be an entity without ceasing to exist. It lacks its own Identity Condition (+O) or inherited Identity Condition (+I) because the criteria for identifying entities vary wildly across sub-types (e.g., identity for a set is different from identity for a person). It is non-unifying because some entities are wholes (+U) while others are scattered amounts (~U).	
Food	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Food	~R	-I	-O	~U	+D	Phased-Mixin / Role	Food is anti-rigid (~R) because it is a functional role an entity plays; a tomato is still a tomato when it ceases to be food. It lacks own identity (-O) and identity conditions (-I) because its instances (meat, grain, oil) satisfy different ICs. It is anti-unity (~U) because it includes masses/aggregates and is externally dependent (+D) on a consumer that uses it for nutrition.

Group	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Group	+R	+I	+O	~U	+D	Non-Unitary Sortal (Aggregate)	A Group is rigid because its members couldn't cease to be a group and remain the same entity. It supplies its own identity conditions based on its membership composition. It is anti-unity (~U) because it is defined as a sum or collection of parts rather than an intrinsic whole with a specific topological connection. It is dependent (+D) because a group cannot exist without the members that constitute it.	
GroupOfPeople	http://example.org/guarino-messy#GroupOfPeople	+R	+I	+O	~U	-D	Sortal (Collective)	A GroupOfPeople is rigid (+R) because if an entity is a group, it cannot cease to be a group without losing its identity. it supplies its own identity condition (+O/+I) based on its membership composition. It is anti-unity (~U) because, as a collection, it is a sum of its parts (individuals) rather than a single intrinsic whole with a topological connection.	
LegalAgent	http://example.org/guarino-messy#LegalAgent	-R	+I	-O	-U	-D	Non-Rigid Mixin	LegalAgent is non-rigid because it is not essential for all its instances (e.g., a Person may be a LegalAgent at one time and not another). It carries identity (+I) inherited from its specific sub-types (Person, Organization) but does not supply a single global identity condition (+O) because it covers disjoint taxonomies with different identity criteria. It is non-unifying (-U) as it applies to entities with different unity criteria.	
LivingBeing	http://example.org/guarino-messy#LivingBeing	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Type / Sortal	Being a 'Living Being' is essential to its instances (Rigid); an animal cannot cease being alive and remain the same entity. It supplies its own identity conditions (living organisms have specific criteria for persistence over time) and implies a unified whole (Unity) rather than a mere collection of parts.	
Location	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Location	+R	-I	-O	-U	+D	Non-Sortal / Attribute	Location is typically a rigid property (an entity's spatial existence is essential to its identity in a specific context), but it acts as a non-sortal because it does not supply a unique identity condition (it is often a coordinate or a relation to a reference frame). It is dependent on the existence of a spatial manifold or the objects occupying it.	
Organization	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Organization	+R	+I	+O	+U	+D	Type (Substantial Sortal)	Organization is a Rigid property because an instance cannot cease to be an organization without ceasing to exist. It supplies its own Identity Condition (+O, +I) often defined by legal registration or structural formation. It exhibits Unity (+U) as its members form a functional whole. It is Dependent (+D) because an organization requires the existence of constituent agents or a legal framework to exist.	
Person	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Person	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Substantial Sortal	A person is a Substantial Sortal because it is rigid (if someone is a person, they cannot cease to be a person without ceasing to exist), it provides its own unique identity condition for its instances, and it represents a unified whole that does not inherently depend on the existence of another specific entity for its definition.

Red	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Red	-R	-I	-O	-U	-D	Attributive Mixin	Red is non-rigid because a physical object can change color and still exist. It does not carry or supply an identity condition (we do not identify objects solely by their 'redness'). It is non-unifying because parts of a red object are also red, yet they don't necessarily constitute a single whole.	
RedApple	http://example.org/guarino-messy#RedApple	-R	+I	-O	+U	-D	Attributive Property / Sub-Kind	RedApple is non-rigid because an apple can change color (e.g., from green to red or vice versa) without losing its identity as an apple. It carries identity (+I) and unity (+U) inherited from the 'Apple' sortal, but it does not supply its own unique identity condition (-O) over and above being an apple.	
SocialEntity	http://example.org/guarino-messy#SocialEntity	+R	-I	-O	-U	+D	Non-Sortal / Mixin	SocialEntity is likely a rigid property as a social entity cannot cease to be one without losing its existence, but it does not supply global identity conditions because identity depends on specific sub-types (e.g., Person vs Organization). It is a Mixin as it characterizes entities across different hierarchies. Finally, it is dependent because it requires a social context or underlying physical agents to exist.	
Vertebrate	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Vertebrate	+R	-I	-O	+U	-D	Non-substantial Sortal	Vertebrate is Rigid because an animal that possesses a backbone cannot cease to be a vertebrate and still exist. It is a Non-substantial Sortal because while it carries identity (+I), it likely inherits it from a higher-level category like 'Animal', thus it does not supply its own unique global identity condition (-O). It is +U as vertebrates are unified whole organisms, and -D as they do not require a separate external object to exist (unlike a Role).
