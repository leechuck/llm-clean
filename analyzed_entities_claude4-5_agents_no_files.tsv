Butterfly	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Butterfly	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Sortal (Rigid, supplies identity)	Butterfly is a rigid property because any instance that is a butterfly is necessarily a butterfly in all possible worlds where it exists. A butterfly cannot cease to be a butterfly and become something else while remaining the same individual - it is an essential biological classification. While a caterpillar transforms into a butterfly, they are considered different life stages of the same organism, and once something is a butterfly (the adult form of Lepidoptera), it remains essentially a butterfly throughout its existence as that individual.	Butterfly carries a strong identity condition. Individual butterflies can be distinguished and re-identified through various means including their physical body (spatio-temporal continuity), unique wing pattern variations, DNA, and continuous biological existence from emergence through their lifespan. Each butterfly maintains its identity as the same individual organism over time despite changes in location, minor physical wear, or behavioral states. This is a paradigmatic example of a natural kind with clear identity criteria based on biological individuality.	Butterfly supplies its own identity condition as a biological organism. A butterfly is individuated and tracked through time as a specific physical organism with its own spatiotemporal continuity, biological properties, and life history. It provides the criteria for distinguishing one butterfly from another (this specific organism vs. that specific organism) and for re-identifying the same butterfly over time despite changes in its properties (location, wing damage, etc.). The identity condition is grounded in being a particular living physical entity, not inherited from a more general sortal. While 'Butterfly' is a specialization of more general kinds like 'Insect' or 'Animal', it functions as a sortal concept that supplies its own robust identity criteria at the level of individual organisms.	A butterfly is a unifying entity with highly integrated biological parts that work together as a functional whole. The wings, body segments (head, thorax, abdomen), sensory organs, digestive system, and circulatory system are all interconnected parts that form a single, cohesive organism with clear mereological boundaries. The parts are not arbitrary but rather form an intrinsic biological unity necessary for the butterfly's survival and function. A butterfly maintains its identity as a whole organism, and removing essential parts would destroy the unity of the entity.	A butterfly is an independent physical organism. Once it exists as a butterfly (having completed metamorphosis), it does not intrinsically depend on any specific other entity for its existence. While butterflies require environmental conditions like air, food sources, and habitat to survive, these are external dependencies for sustaining life rather than constitutive dependencies for existence. A butterfly exists as a complete, self-contained biological entity in its own right, similar to other animals and physical objects.	
Red	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Red	-R	-I	-O	-U	+D	Attribution (Non-rigid, no identity)	Red is a non-rigid property because objects can gain or lose the property of being red without ceasing to exist. For example, an apple can be green, then ripen and become red, or a red car can be painted blue. The object remains the same entity but loses the property of being red. Since instances can exist without being red at all times, and the property is not essential to their identity, Red is classified as -R (Non-Rigid).	Red is a quality/property that does not carry an identity condition. There is no principled way to distinguish one instance of red from another instance of red, or to say that 'this red' at time t1 is the same as 'that red' at time t2. Red is a dependent entity that can only exist as inhering in some substrate (like an apple or a car), but the redness itself has no independent identity criteria. We cannot re-identify or count instances of red in a meaningful way - we can only identify and count the red objects that bear this quality.	Red is a quality/property that describes color characteristics of objects. As a quality, it does not supply its own identity condition - it depends on the object that bears it for identity. Red instances are distinguished by the objects they inhere in (e.g., 'the redness of this apple' vs 'the redness of that car'). Since Red was determined to be -I (carries no identity condition), it cannot be +O, as +O requires +I. Red neither carries nor supplies an identity condition.	Red is a quality or property that can be predicated of various objects, not a sortal that denotes whole entities. Instances of 'red things' lack any intrinsic mereological unity - they form arbitrary collections (red cars, red apples, red patches) with no integrated structure connecting them. The red parts of an object are not unified by redness itself, but by whatever whole they happen to belong to. Red does not carry any unifying principle that would make its instances integrated wholes.	Red is a dependent entity because it cannot exist without being instantiated in or attributed to some physical object or substrate. Redness requires a bearer - something must be red (an apple, a car, a surface, etc.). The color red has no independent existence; it is always a property or quality of something else. This makes it intrinsically dependent on other entities for its existence.	
Food	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Food	-R	-I	-O	-U	-D	Attribution (Non-rigid, no identity)	Food is non-rigid because entities can gain or lose the property of being food without losing their identity. For example, a piece of fruit is food, but if it becomes rotten and inedible, it ceases to be food while remaining the same physical object. Similarly, something may not be considered food in one context or culture but becomes food in another (e.g., insects, certain plants). The property of being food is contingent and depends on factors like edibility, cultural norms, and condition, rather than being essential to the entity's identity across all possible worlds.	Food does not carry an identity condition. While a specific food item (like 'this apple') can be identified, 'Food' as a general category lacks a principled way to establish identity across instances. The same matter can transition between being food and non-food (e.g., expired food), and food can be divided or combined without clear identity persistence. What constitutes 'the same food' over time is ambiguous - if I eat half an apple, is it still the same food? If ingredients are mixed into a cake, do they maintain identity as food or become new food? The property 'Food' describes a functional role (something edible/nutritious) rather than carrying inherent identity conditions for distinguishing and re-identifying instances over time.	Food does not supply its own identity condition. As established in the Identity analysis, Food is -I (does not carry identity). According to the constraint that +O requires +I, Food must be -O. Additionally, Food is a role concept - the same physical matter can be food or not depending on context (edibility, intended use). The identity condition for any instance of Food comes from what it is materially (e.g., an apple as a physical object, bread as a manufactured item), not from being food per se. Food describes a function or purpose rather than providing the fundamental basis for individuation.	Food lacks unity because instances do not form intrinsic wholes with integrated parts. A food item can be arbitrarily divided (half a sandwich is still food), combined (mixing foods doesn't create a new unified whole), or scattered (a meal with separate components). The boundaries of what constitutes 'a food' are conventional rather than based on intrinsic mereological structure. Unlike a person or car where parts are functionally integrated into a whole, food can be any amount or arrangement of edible matter without requiring wholeness or integration.	Food is independent because instances of food can exist as physical substances without intrinsically depending on other specific entities. While food requires production processes and may be consumed by organisms, the food itself (e.g., an apple, a loaf of bread) exists as a physical object that doesn't depend on any particular consumer, producer, or other entity for its continued existence. The substance maintains its identity as food regardless of whether it is actually consumed or who produced it.	
Animal	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Animal	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Sortal (Rigid, supplies identity)	Animal is a rigid property because anything that is an animal is necessarily an animal in all possible worlds throughout its entire existence. An entity cannot start or stop being an animal - if something is an animal, it is essentially and immutably an animal from the moment it begins to exist until it ceases to exist. A dog cannot become a non-animal while continuing to exist as the same entity, nor can a non-animal become an animal. This satisfies the definition of rigidity: the property is essential to ALL instances in ALL possible worlds.	Animal carries a strong identity condition. Individual animals can be distinguished and re-identified over time through multiple criteria: biological/genetic makeup (DNA), spatio-temporal continuity (tracking the same organism through space and time), and physiological structure. For example, a particular dog can be identified as the same individual from birth through maturity despite changes in size, appearance, or behavior. The biological continuity of the organism provides clear identity conditions that allow us to say 'this is the same animal' at different points in time.	Animal supplies its own identity condition based on being a distinct biological organism with continuous physical and biological existence. An animal's identity is determined by its status as a unified living being with its own life cycle, not inherited from a more general property. While 'Physical Object' or 'Living Thing' might also carry identity, Animal provides a more specific biological identity condition rooted in organismal continuity and biological individuation. This is its own identity criterion, not merely inherited.	Animal carries unity (+U) because instances are intrinsic biological wholes with integrated physiological systems. Each animal has a clear mereological structure with functionally interdependent parts (circulatory, nervous, digestive systems, etc.) that work together to maintain the organism's life. The parts of an animal are not arbitrary - they are unified by biological organization and homeostatic processes. An animal cannot be arbitrarily partitioned without destroying its essential nature as a living organism.	An Animal is independent because individual animals exist as autonomous entities without intrinsically depending on any specific other entity for their existence. While animals may have ecological relationships (predator-prey, symbiosis) or historical dependencies (offspring depend on parents during development), a mature animal instance does not require a specific relationship to another particular entity to exist. The animal itself persists as an entity regardless of its relationships with other entities.	
RedApple	http://example.org/guarino-messy#RedApple	-R	+I	-O	+U	-D	Category or Mixin (Non-rigid)	RedApple is non-rigid because an instance can lose the property of being red while remaining an apple. An apple can be red at one time and turn green or brown at another time (e.g., ripening, decay), but it remains the same individual apple. The color red is not essential to all instances of red apples across all possible worlds - a red apple could have been green or could become non-red without ceasing to be that particular apple.	RedApple carries an identity condition inherited from its base kind 'Apple', which is a physical object. Each red apple can be distinguished and re-identified through spatio-temporal continuity - we can track the same red apple over time even as its color may fade or its properties change. The addition of 'Red' as a qualifying property does not remove the underlying identity condition that comes from being an Apple (a material object). While the redness itself (-I) doesn't carry identity, the entity 'RedApple' refers to apples that happen to be red, and apples as physical objects have clear identity conditions.	RedApple does not supply its own identity condition. As a specialized type of Apple (or Physical Object), it inherits its identity condition from its more general parent property. The identity of a RedApple is determined by being a particular physical apple object, not by any identity criteria unique to being red. The 'red' aspect is an additional qualification (a color property) that restricts the set but does not establish new identity criteria. The identity condition comes from Apple/Physical Object, which supplies the spatio-temporal continuity criteria that individuates one apple from another.	RedApple inherits the unity property from its superclass Apple, which itself inherits from physical objects like Fruit. An instance of RedApple is an integrated biological whole with a clear mereological structure - it has functionally organized parts (skin, flesh, core, seeds, stem) that work together as a unified organism. The property 'red' is merely a color qualification and does not affect the underlying unity of the apple as a physical object. Each red apple is a single, cohesive entity with topological closure and functional integration of its parts.	RedApple instances are independent entities that do not intrinsically depend on other specific entities for their existence. A red apple exists as a physical object in its own right - it is a fruit with particular properties (redness, apple characteristics). While a red apple may have historical dependencies (it grew on a tree, was cultivated by farmers), these are not intrinsic dependencies - the red apple continues to exist as a red apple even after being separated from the tree or removed from any particular context. It does not require the ongoing existence of another entity to maintain its identity as a red apple, unlike dependent entities such as 'Student' which requires an educational institution or 'Employee' which requires an employer.	
Group	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Group	+R	+I	+O	~U	-D	Sortal (Rigid, supplies identity)	Group is rigid because any entity that is a group is necessarily a group in all possible worlds where it exists. A group is defined by its nature as a collection or organization of entities treated as a unit. While the membership of a group can change (adding or removing members), and a group can cease to exist entirely, as long as something exists as a group, it cannot stop being a group while continuing to exist as that same entity. The identity of a group is tied to its nature as a collective entity - it cannot lose this property and remain the same individual. This is distinct from anti-rigid properties like 'Student Group' (a role a group plays) or 'Small Group' (a contingent phase). The sortal 'Group' itself provides essential identity conditions for its instances.	Group carries an identity condition. A group can be distinguished and re-identified by its membership composition and organizational structure. Two groups are the same if they have the same members organized in the same way, even if membership may change over time according to specific rules. For example, a particular sports team, committee, or family can be identified and tracked over time through its constitutive members and their relationships, providing a clear criterion for identity and re-identification.	Group supplies its own identity condition. A group is identified by its specific membership composition - two groups are the same if and only if they have exactly the same members. This is distinct from other identity conditions like spatiotemporal continuity (for physical objects) or social role continuity (for organizations). Group provides a set-theoretic identity criterion: extensional identity based on member composition. This makes Group a rigid designator that supplies its own global identity condition, independent of other properties it may instantiate.	A Group is a paradigmatic example of an anti-unity property. Instances are strict aggregates or collections of members without mereological integration. The parts (members) maintain their individual identity and independence, lacking the functional or structural integration that characterizes wholes. A group of people, for instance, is simply the sum of its members with no intrinsic unifying relation beyond membership itself.	A Group is independent because its instances do not intrinsically depend on specific other entities to exist. While a group necessarily has members, the group itself is not existentially dependent on any particular member or external entity. Members can change, leave, or be replaced without destroying the group's identity. The group exists as an independent collective entity, even though it requires having some members (a definitional requirement, not an existential dependence on specific individuals). For example, a committee continues to exist as the same group even when all original members are replaced over time.	
Country	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Country	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Sortal (Rigid, supplies identity)	Country is a rigid property because anything that is a country is necessarily a country in terms of its fundamental nature as a geopolitical entity. While the borders, government, or name of a country may change, and a country may cease to exist or come into being, when something IS a country, it cannot be a country contingently - it cannot be a country in some contexts and not in others while continuing to exist as the same entity. A country cannot lose the property of being a country and remain the same individual; if it ceases to be a country (e.g., through dissolution or annexation), it ceases to exist as that entity. This makes Country a rigid sortal that provides essential identity conditions for its instances.	Country carries a clear identity condition. Instances of Country can be distinguished and re-identified through multiple identity criteria including: geographical boundaries (territory), sovereignty status, international recognition, governmental structure, and legal continuity. For example, France remains the same country over time despite changes in government, population, or even minor border adjustments. The identity persists through a combination of territorial continuity, legal/political continuity, and international recognition. We can definitively say 'this is the same country' across time periods, making Country a property that carries an identity condition.	Country supplies its own identity condition. A country is identified by its sovereign territory, internationally recognized borders, and governmental authority over a specific geographic area. This identity condition is fundamental to what makes a country a distinct entity and is not inherited from a more general category. The identity of a country persists even through changes in government, population, or economic systems, as long as the sovereign territorial entity remains. For example, France remains the same country despite centuries of governmental changes, because the identity condition (sovereign territorial entity) is supplied by Country itself, not inherited from a broader type.	A Country is a unifying entity with integrated parts that form a cohesive whole. Its components (territory, government, population, legal system, infrastructure) are functionally interconnected and depend on each other to maintain the country's identity and operations. The government provides organizational structure across the territory, laws apply uniformly, and citizens share political identity. Unlike arbitrary collections, removing or radically changing core components (e.g., eliminating the government or losing sovereignty) would threaten the country's existence as that particular entity. Countries exhibit clear mereological boundaries and functional integration that distinguish them from mere aggregates of land or people.	Countries are independent entities that do not intrinsically depend on other specific entities for their existence. While countries may have political, economic, and social relationships with other countries, and depend on factors like territory, population, and governance structures, these dependencies are not to specific external entities in a way that makes the country's existence contingent upon them. A country exists as a sovereign entity defined by its own territory, government, and people, rather than being fundamentally dependent on another particular entity. The concept of sovereignty itself implies independence from external control or necessary dependence on other countries.	
AmountOfMatter	http://example.org/guarino-messy#AmountOfMatter	+R	-I	-O	-U	-D	Attribution or Quality	AmountOfMatter is rigid because anything that is an amount of matter is necessarily and essentially an amount of matter in all possible worlds. An amount of matter cannot cease to be an amount of matter while continuing to exist - its identity as a quantity of material substance is essential to what it is. The amount may change in measure or composition, but the entity qua 'amount of matter' remains essentially that type of entity throughout its existence. This is similar to how quantities and material portions are typically considered rigid - their fundamental nature as material quantities is invariant.	AmountOfMatter does not carry an identity condition. There is no principled way to distinguish one amount of matter from another amount of the same substance with the same quantity. For example, if we have two identical amounts of water (say, 1 liter each), there is no intrinsic property that allows us to identify which is which or track them over time if they are mixed and separated again. Unlike physical objects that have spatio-temporal continuity, amounts of matter lack the criteria needed for re-identification - they are quantities rather than countable individuals.	AmountOfMatter does not supply its own identity condition. As determined in the Identity analysis, AmountOfMatter is -I (does not carry identity). Since it cannot carry identity, it cannot supply one either (the constraint states +O requires +I). AmountOfMatter refers to quantities or measures of substance that lack intrinsic identity criteria - the same amount of matter (e.g., '5 kg of water') does not have a unique identity across contexts or compositions. It inherits any identity considerations from more specific properties (like particular portions or samples) but provides none itself.	AmountOfMatter refers to a quantity of physical substance without any inherent mereological structure or integration principle. The parts of an amount of matter are arbitrary - any portion of the matter counts as part of the amount, and there is no functional or organizational principle that unifies these parts into a whole. Unlike integrated wholes (+U) such as organisms or artifacts, or strict aggregates (~U) like collections, AmountOfMatter represents scattered or arbitrarily divisible quantities where unity depends entirely on external criteria (e.g., spatial containment, measurement context) rather than intrinsic integration.	AmountOfMatter refers to a quantity of physical substance or material. Instances of AmountOfMatter (e.g., a quantity of water, a mass of iron, an amount of oxygen) exist independently and do not intrinsically depend on other specific entities for their existence. While matter may participate in various relationships and can be measured or contained, the matter itself persists independently. A quantity of water remains water whether it's in a glass, ocean, or vapor form - its existence as matter does not depend on these contexts or other entities.	
PhysicalObject	http://example.org/guarino-messy#PhysicalObject	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Sortal (Rigid, supplies identity)	PhysicalObject is a rigid property because anything that is a physical object is necessarily a physical object in all possible worlds where it exists. An entity cannot exist as a physical object in one world and as a non-physical object in another world while maintaining its identity. The property of being physical (having mass, occupying space, existing in the physical realm) is essential to all instances of PhysicalObject across all possible scenarios. Once something is a physical object, it cannot cease to be physical and remain the same entity.	PhysicalObject carries a strong identity condition based on spatio-temporal continuity. Individual physical objects can be distinguished from one another and re-identified across time through their continuous existence in space and time. For example, a specific chair can be identified as the same chair from yesterday based on its physical continuity, even if some properties change (like color if painted). Physical objects maintain their identity through their material constitution and spatial location trajectory, making it possible to definitively answer 'is this the same physical object?' across different temporal contexts.	PhysicalObject supplies its own identity condition based on spatiotemporal continuity and physical boundaries. A physical object is identified and distinguished from other physical objects through its continuous existence in space and time, occupying a specific location and maintaining physical coherence. This is a fundamental identity criterion that PhysicalObject provides directly, rather than inheriting from a more general property. It establishes the basic principle that two physical objects are the same if and only if they trace the same spatiotemporal path and maintain the same material continuity.	PhysicalObject is unifying (+U) because instances are intrinsic wholes with clear mereological structure. A physical object maintains spatial and material integration - its parts are connected and form a cohesive unity (e.g., a rock, a tree, a chair). The parts of a physical object are not arbitrary but constitute a unified whole occupying a contiguous region of space with material continuity. This distinguishes physical objects from mere collections or scattered aggregates.	PhysicalObject is independent because instances of physical objects can exist without intrinsically depending on other specific entities. A rock, tree, or building exists in its own right and does not require the existence of another particular entity to maintain its identity or existence. While physical objects may have causal or temporal relationships with other entities (e.g., being created by something, being located somewhere), they do not have the kind of essential, intrinsic dependence that characterizes dependent entities. Their identity and existence are self-sustained rather than parasitic on or necessarily tied to other specific individuals.	
GroupOfPeople	http://example.org/guarino-messy#GroupOfPeople	+R	+I	+O	~U	-D	Sortal (Rigid, supplies identity)	GroupOfPeople is rigid because any instance that is a group of people is necessarily a group of people in all possible worlds where it exists. The essential nature of being a collection/group of persons cannot be lost without the entity ceasing to exist as that particular group. While the membership may change (people joining or leaving), this would typically result in a different group rather than the same group losing its property of being a group of people. The grouping relation and the type of entities grouped (people) are essential to the identity of any instance of GroupOfPeople.	GroupOfPeople carries an identity condition. A group of people can be distinguished and re-identified based on its membership composition at any given time. We can identify the same group over time by tracking which specific individuals constitute it, even as the group's activities or location change. For example, 'The Beatles' or 'the marketing team' are identifiable groups with specific members that allow us to recognize them as the same group across different contexts and times. The identity condition is provided by the collective membership relation, which determines which individuals belong to the group.	GroupOfPeople supplies its own identity condition that is distinct from its constituent members. A group is identified by its membership composition and organizational structure, not by the identity of any single member. For example, 'The Beatles' remains the same group based on its specific four members, even though each member is also a Person with their own identity. The group's identity condition (which members compose it, and potentially how they're organized) is unique to the group concept and not inherited from a more general property. This differs from roles like 'Student' which inherit identity from Person.	GroupOfPeople is anti-unity because instances are mereological sums or aggregates of people without inherent integration. A group of people lacks the functional or structural integration that characterizes true wholes - the people can be arbitrarily selected, spatially scattered, and do not form a unified entity with interdependent parts. The individuals maintain their autonomy and the 'grouping' is typically based on external criteria (location, purpose, classification) rather than intrinsic unifying relationships. This is a paradigmatic case of anti-unity, similar to 'collection' - the whole is simply the sum of independent parts.	GroupOfPeople is independent because group instances do not intrinsically depend on any specific other entities to exist. While a group is constituted by individual people (its members), the group itself exists as a collective entity without requiring dependence on external entities beyond its membership. The people who comprise the group are part of the group's identity, not external dependencies. Groups can form, persist, and be identified as distinct social entities without requiring relationships to other types of entities outside of having members.	
LivingBeing	http://example.org/guarino-messy#LivingBeing	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Sortal (Rigid, supplies identity)	LivingBeing is rigid because anything that is a living being is necessarily a living being in all possible worlds where it exists. An entity cannot exist as a living being and then become a non-living being while continuing to exist - death represents the cessation of existence for that living being, not a transition to a different state of the same entity. The property of being alive is essential to the identity of a living being throughout its entire existence.	LivingBeing carries a strong identity condition. Living beings maintain identity through biological continuity - they can be distinguished and re-identified over time through mechanisms like genetic makeup, biological organization, and continuous metabolic processes. Despite changes in cellular composition or physical characteristics, a living being remains the same individual organism throughout its lifecycle (e.g., a person remains identifiable from birth through adulthood despite physical changes). This biological and spatio-temporal continuity provides a principled way to distinguish one living being from another and track it over time.	LivingBeing supplies its own identity condition based on biological continuity and spatio-temporal existence. A living being is identified as the same individual over time through continuous biological processes, metabolism, and physical persistence. This is a fundamental, global identity condition that is not inherited from a more general property - it establishes what makes one living being numerically distinct from another. Since this property provides the foundational criterion for distinguishing and tracking individual living organisms across time and space, it supplies its own identity condition.	LivingBeing is unifying (+U) because instances are intrinsic wholes with integrated parts that exhibit homeostasis, metabolism, and organized biological structure. A living being maintains functional unity through coordinated physiological processes - its parts (organs, cells, systems) work together as an integrated whole rather than as arbitrary collections. The removal or disruption of parts affects the entire organism, demonstrating mereological integration. Each living being has clear spatial and functional boundaries that distinguish it as a unified entity.	LivingBeing is independent as instances do not intrinsically depend on other specific entities for their existence. While living beings require environmental conditions (nutrients, suitable habitat) and have biological dependencies (offspring depend on parents initially), the identity of a living being as an entity does not necessitate a relationship with any particular other entity. A living being exists as a distinct individual organism regardless of its relationships with other specific entities. This contrasts with dependent entities like 'Student' which cannot exist without an educational institution, or 'Employee' which requires an employer. A living being's existence is self-contained at the ontological level.	
SocialEntity	http://example.org/guarino-messy#SocialEntity	+R	+I	+O	-U	-D	Sortal (Rigid, supplies identity)	SocialEntity is rigid because anything that is a social entity is necessarily a social entity in all possible worlds where it exists. Social entities (organizations, institutions, communities, etc.) are fundamentally defined by their social nature - this property is essential to their identity. An entity cannot exist as a social entity and then cease to be social while maintaining the same identity. While specific instances may cease to exist (e.g., a company dissolves), they cannot lose their social nature and remain the same entity. The property 'being social' is essential to all instances of SocialEntity across all possible worlds.	SocialEntity carries an identity condition. Social entities (such as organizations, institutions, groups, or roles) can be distinguished and re-identified over time through their constitutive rules, membership criteria, legal recognition, or social agreements. For example, a corporation maintains identity through its legal charter and continuity of purpose even as members change; a family maintains identity through kinship relations. While social entities may lack physical boundaries, they have well-defined social and institutional criteria that establish their identity conditions, allowing us to distinguish one social entity from another and track them over time.	SocialEntity supplies its own identity condition. Social entities are identified by their constitutive social agreements, institutional facts, or collective recognition (e.g., a corporation is identified by its charter and legal registration, a marriage by its legal or social sanction). This identity condition is not inherited from a more general property but is specific to the social domain - it's what makes social entities ontologically distinct from purely physical or mental entities. The identity of a social entity persists through changes in physical substrate or individual participants based on continuity of social recognition and institutional structure.	SocialEntity lacks unity as it encompasses diverse instances with varying degrees of integration. While some social entities like organizations may exhibit structural integration through roles and relationships, others like social networks or demographic categories (e.g., 'middle class', 'alumni') are merely collections without intrinsic mereological structure. The category itself does not guarantee that instances form integrated wholes with unified parts - a social entity could be anything from a tightly integrated corporation to a loosely defined social group with arbitrary membership boundaries. The heterogeneity of what constitutes a social entity prevents attribution of consistent unity criteria.	SocialEntity represents a broad category encompassing various socially constructed entities (organizations, groups, institutions, etc.). While social entities emerge from and involve relationships between individuals, they do not intrinsically depend on any specific other entity for their existence. A social entity like an organization or group can exist as long as there are participants or members, but it doesn't depend on one particular external entity. The dependence is on the collective of participants rather than on another distinct entity type, making it independent in the ontological sense. Individual instances (like a specific company or club) maintain their identity through their social structure rather than through necessary dependence on other entities.	
Location	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Location	+R	+I	+O	-U	-D	Sortal (Rigid, supplies identity)	Location is rigid because anything that is a location is necessarily a location in all possible worlds. A spatial position or place cannot cease to be a location while continuing to exist as the same entity. Even if a location becomes empty, abandoned, or changes in other properties, it remains fundamentally a location. The concept of location is essential to its identity - there is no possible world where something is a location in one moment and not a location in another while remaining the same entity.	Location carries an identity condition. A location can be distinguished and re-identified through its spatial coordinates or reference system (geographic coordinates, address, spatial boundaries, or position relative to other entities). Two locations can be determined to be the same or different based on their spatial properties, and a location maintains its identity through time via its spatial continuity. For example, 'Paris' or 'coordinates (48.8566°N, 2.3522°E)' provide clear identity criteria that allow us to recognize the same location across different times and contexts.	Location supplies its own identity condition. Two locations are the same location if and only if they occupy the same spatial coordinates or region. This identity criterion is intrinsic to what it means to be a location - it is defined by spatial boundaries and position. Location does not inherit its identity from a more general category; rather, it provides the fundamental criterion (spatial extent/position) by which locations are individuated and distinguished from one another.	Location is non-unifying because instances (particular locations) do not necessarily form integrated wholes with unified mereological structure. A location can be arbitrary in extent and composition - it might be a precisely bounded room, a vaguely defined neighborhood, or a scattered set of non-contiguous coordinates. The parts of a location (sub-regions, points, areas) lack the functional or structural integration characteristic of +U entities. Unlike a Person or Car where parts work together as an integrated system, the portions of a location are simply spatial subdivisions without inherent unity or cohesion. Locations are not mere aggregates (~U) as they can have some spatial continuity, but they lack the intrinsic wholeness required for +U classification.	Location is independent as instances of locations can exist without necessarily depending on other specific entities for their existence. A location exists as a spatial region or position regardless of whether anything occupies it or references it. While locations may be identified or described in relation to other locations (e.g., 'north of the city'), this is epistemic rather than ontological dependence. The spatial region itself doesn't cease to exist if the reference points change or disappear. Geographic locations, coordinates, and spatial positions maintain their existence independently of other entities.	
Fruit	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Fruit	-R	+I	+O	+U	+D	Category or Mixin (Non-rigid)	Fruit is non-rigid because an object can become a fruit (when a flower's ovary matures after fertilization) and can cease to be a fruit (when it rots or is consumed, losing its essential fruit characteristics). The same physical matter that constitutes a fruit was previously part of a flower and may later become decomposed organic matter. Being a fruit is not essential to the entity across all possible worlds or throughout its entire existence.	Fruit carries an identity condition. Each individual fruit can be distinguished and re-identified through its spatio-temporal continuity as a physical object. A specific apple, for instance, maintains its identity over time through its material constitution and spatial location, even as it undergoes changes (ripening, decay). We can point to a particular fruit at time T1 and recognize it as the same fruit at time T2 based on physical continuity criteria, despite changes in properties like color or firmness.	Fruit supplies its own identity condition as a biological entity. A fruit is individuated by its spatio-temporal boundaries as a distinct physical object that develops from the mature ovary of a flower. Each fruit has its own continuous existence from formation through maturity and decomposition. While 'fruit' inherits some identity aspects from 'physical object', it provides a more specific identity condition at the biological level - a fruit remains the same fruit through changes in ripeness, color, or minor physical alterations, but not through division or merger. This is a natural kind term that supplies identity criteria appropriate to its level of generality in the biological domain.	A fruit is a unifying property. Each instance of fruit is an intrinsic whole with integrated parts forming a functional biological structure. A fruit has a clear mereological organization: skin/peel, flesh/pulp, seeds, and often a core, all unified through continuous organic tissue. The parts are not arbitrary—they develop together as a coordinated biological unit from a flower's ovary. Removing or separating essential parts (like cutting a fruit in half) destroys the identity of that particular fruit whole, though the pieces remain fruit tissue. The spatial and functional unity is maintained through the fruit's biological structure and developmental origin as a single reproductive organ.	Fruit is dependent because individual fruit instances intrinsically depend on the plant/tree that produces them for their existence. A fruit cannot come into being without a parent plant organism. Even after harvest, the fruit's identity and essential properties (its botanical nature, its role in seed dispersal, its nutritional composition) are determined by and dependent upon the specific plant species that produced it. This represents an existential dependence relationship - no fruit can exist without having been produced by a plant.	
Vertebrate	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Vertebrate	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Sortal (Rigid, supplies identity)	Vertebrate is a rigid property because any entity that is a vertebrate possesses a backbone/spinal column as an essential anatomical feature. This structural characteristic cannot be lost or gained - an organism cannot cease to be a vertebrate or become one after existing without this feature. Throughout all possible worlds and temporal states, if something is a vertebrate, it is necessarily and immutably a vertebrate. This is a fundamental biological classification based on essential anatomical structure, not a contingent or temporary property.	Vertebrate carries an identity condition through its biological nature as an organism. Each vertebrate instance can be distinguished and re-identified based on genetic makeup, physical body continuity, and spatio-temporal trajectory. A specific vertebrate (e.g., a particular cat or human) maintains its identity over time through its continuous physical existence as an individual organism, even as it undergoes changes. The property inherits identity conditions from its parent kind 'organism' or 'animal', which have well-defined criteria for individuation and persistence.	Vertebrate supplies its own identity condition based on having a specific vertebral column/backbone as part of its anatomical structure. While it is a subtype of Animal, it provides a more specific identity criterion - two vertebrates are the same if and only if they have the same vertebral column/body. This represents a refinement of the animal identity condition that is specific to vertebrates as organisms with this particular anatomical feature. The presence of a vertebral column provides the structural basis for individuating vertebrates as distinct biological entities.	Vertebrate instances are intrinsic wholes with clear mereological structure. Each vertebrate is a unified biological organism with an integrated skeletal system (vertebral column), coordinated physiological systems (nervous, circulatory, digestive), and functionally interdependent parts. The vertebral column itself provides structural unity, and all body parts work together as a cohesive living system. A vertebrate cannot be arbitrarily divided while maintaining its identity - removing parts destroys the integrated whole. This integration and functional wholeness qualifies Vertebrate as strongly unifying (+U).	Vertebrate instances (individual animals with backbones) exist independently without intrinsically depending on other specific entities for their existence. While vertebrates may have biological relationships (predator-prey, symbiosis) or developmental dependencies (offspring depend on parents initially), these are not intrinsic identity-defining dependencies. A vertebrate animal continues to exist as a vertebrate regardless of its relationships with other entities. The defining characteristic (having a backbone/vertebral column) is an intrinsic property that doesn't require another entity to maintain the vertebrate's existence or identity.	
Caterpillar	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Caterpillar	~R	+I	-O	+U	-D	Role or Phase (Anti-rigid)	Caterpillar is anti-rigid because it represents a temporary life phase of certain insects (butterflies and moths). Any instance of a caterpillar is only contingently a caterpillar - it necessarily transitions to a pupa and then an adult form (butterfly or moth). The entity exists before becoming a caterpillar (as an egg/larva) and continues to exist after ceasing to be a caterpillar (as an adult). Being a caterpillar is a phase that instances cannot maintain throughout their entire existence, making it essentially temporary and thus anti-rigid.	Caterpillar carries an identity condition. A caterpillar is a specific developmental stage of a lepidopteran (butterfly or moth) organism. Each caterpillar can be distinguished and re-identified through physical continuity, unique genetic identity (DNA), and spatio-temporal location. Even though a caterpillar undergoes metamorphosis into a butterfly or moth, the underlying organism maintains identity throughout its life cycle. We can point to a specific caterpillar and track it as the same individual over time based on its continuous existence as a biological organism.	Caterpillar does not supply its own identity condition. It inherits its identity condition from a more general property like 'Organism' or 'Animal'. A caterpillar's identity is tied to being a specific biological organism with continuous existence through metabolic processes, cellular identity, and developmental continuity. The property 'Caterpillar' merely describes a particular life stage of certain insects (especially butterflies and moths), not an independent identity-bearing entity. The identity persists beyond the caterpillar stage—the same organism becomes a pupa and then an adult insect. Therefore, while caterpillars carry an identity condition (+I), they do not supply their own; they inherit it from the more fundamental property of being a biological organism.	A caterpillar is a biological organism with an integrated anatomical structure consisting of functionally interdependent parts (head, thorax, abdominal segments, circulatory system, nervous system, digestive system). These parts form a cohesive whole with clear mereological boundaries, maintained by biological processes. The parts cannot be arbitrarily removed or rearranged without destroying the organism's integrity. Each caterpillar instance constitutes a single, unified living entity with intrinsic wholeness, making it a clear example of a unifying property.	A caterpillar is an independent biological entity that exists as a complete organism in its own right during the larval stage of a butterfly or moth. While it depends on food sources and environmental conditions for survival (like all living things), it does not intrinsically depend on any other specific entity for its existence as a caterpillar. It is a self-contained organism with its own biological functions and identity during this developmental phase.	
Person	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Person	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Sortal (Rigid, supplies identity)	Person is a rigid property because anything that is a person is necessarily a person in all possible worlds throughout its existence. An entity cannot cease to be a person while continuing to exist - if something is a person, it remains a person essentially. This is a paradigmatic example of rigidity: personhood is an essential property that defines the very nature of the entity, not a contingent characteristic that can be gained or lost.	Person carries a strong identity condition. Instances of Person can be distinguished from one another and re-identified over time through multiple criteria: biological (DNA, fingerprints, physical continuity), psychological (memory, personality continuity), and social (legal identity, social security numbers). A person maintains their identity despite changes in properties like age, weight, beliefs, or location. We can definitively answer 'is this the same person I met yesterday?' using these identity conditions, which is the hallmark of +I properties.	Person supplies its own global identity condition. A person maintains identity over time through a unique combination of biological continuity, psychological continuity, and spatiotemporal path. This identity condition is not inherited from a more general property but is intrinsic to what it means to be a person. The IC for Person is primitive and fundamental - it defines how we distinguish one person from another across time and possible worlds, making it a classic example of a property that supplies its own identity condition.	Person is a paradigmatic example of a unifying property. Each instance of Person is an intrinsically integrated whole with a clear mereological structure - biological systems (organs, tissues, cells) that work together in a coordinated manner to maintain the organism's life and identity. The parts of a person (head, torso, limbs, organs) are not arbitrary but functionally and causally integrated components that form a coherent whole. A person cannot be arbitrarily divided or have scattered parts while maintaining their identity as a person. This strong integration and inherent wholeness makes Person clearly +U.	Person is an independent entity. While persons may have various relationships and social dependencies, they do not intrinsically depend on any specific other entity for their existence as persons. A person's identity and existence as a person is not contingent upon particular relationships, roles, or other entities. Unlike dependent entities such as 'Student' (which requires an educational institution) or 'Employee' (which requires an employer), a person can exist independently of such contextual relationships.	
LegalAgent	http://example.org/guarino-messy#LegalAgent	+R	+I	+O	-U	-D	Sortal (Rigid, supplies identity)	LegalAgent is rigid because anything that is a legal agent is necessarily a legal agent in all possible worlds where it exists. The capacity to bear legal rights and obligations is an essential characteristic that defines the very nature of being a legal agent. An entity cannot exist as a legal agent and then cease to be one while remaining the same entity - if it loses legal agency, it fundamentally changes its ontological nature. Like 'Person' in philosophical terms, being a legal agent is an essential property that cannot be contingently lost or gained while maintaining identity.	LegalAgent carries a strong identity condition. Legal agents (whether natural persons or legal entities like corporations) can be distinctly identified and re-identified through legal mechanisms such as: birth certificates and social security numbers for natural persons, incorporation documents and tax IDs for legal entities, and legal registration systems. The law provides explicit criteria for determining when a legal agent is the same entity over time, including through name changes, mergers, or succession. Legal systems fundamentally depend on being able to identify and re-identify agents for purposes of rights, obligations, contracts, and liability.	LegalAgent supplies its own identity condition. A legal agent is identified by its legal personhood and capacity to enter into legal relations, which is distinct from and independent of the identity conditions of more specific types (like Person or Organization). The identity of a legal agent is established through legal recognition and registration (e.g., birth certificates for natural persons, incorporation documents for legal entities), providing a global identity condition that encompasses both natural and artificial legal persons. This is not inherited from a more general property but is intrinsic to what it means to be a legal agent in a legal system.	LegalAgent is non-unifying because it applies to entities with vastly different mereological structures. Individual persons are integrated biological wholes (+U), while corporations are social constructs that may span multiple locations and divisions without physical integration. Partnerships and trusts can be even more loosely structured. Since the property must hold uniformly across all instances and legal agents range from tightly integrated individuals to distributed organizations, LegalAgent itself cannot be classified as unifying. The unity characteristics are contingent on the specific type of legal agent rather than intrinsic to the property itself.	LegalAgent is independent because instances can exist without intrinsically depending on specific other entities. A legal agent (whether a person, organization, or other entity recognized by law as capable of rights and obligations) exists as an autonomous entity with legal standing. While legal agents may participate in relationships (contracts, agreements, representations) and operate within legal systems, they do not require these relationships to exist as legal agents. The capacity for legal agency is an intrinsic property of the entity itself, not derived from dependence on other specific entities. For example, a corporation exists as a legal agent independent of any particular contract or client it may serve.	
Entity	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Entity	+R	+I	+O	-U	-D	Sortal (Rigid, supplies identity)	Entity is the most general ontological category that encompasses everything that exists or can exist. Anything that is an entity is necessarily an entity in all possible worlds - there is no possible world where something exists but is not an entity. An entity cannot cease to be an entity while continuing to exist, as 'being an entity' is synonymous with 'being something that exists.' This makes Entity a rigid property, essential to all its instances across all possible worlds.	Entity carries an identity condition as it represents anything that exists or can be individuated. Each entity must be distinguishable from other entities and re-identifiable as the same entity over time - this is the fundamental requirement for something to qualify as an entity at all. The very concept of 'entity' presupposes the ability to individuate and track identity across contexts, even if the specific identity criteria vary by the type of entity. An entity without identity conditions would be a contradiction, as we couldn't distinguish one entity from another or recognize it as existing.	Entity supplies its own identity condition as the most fundamental ontological category. It provides the basic criterion that something exists and can be distinguished from other things. As the top-level concept in ontological hierarchies, Entity establishes the foundational identity condition (existence itself) that all more specific categories inherit or refine. It does not inherit its identity condition from any more general property, as there is no more general category.	Entity is the most general ontological category encompassing everything that exists or can be conceived. Instances of 'Entity' have no inherent mereological structure or integration requirements - they can be unified wholes (like a person), scattered collections (like a group), abstract individuals (like numbers), or anything else. The term itself imposes no unity constraint on its instances, making it non-unifying.	Entity is the most general, top-level concept in ontological hierarchies, representing anything that exists or can be conceived to exist. By definition, entities at this fundamental level do not intrinsically depend on other specific entities for their existence - they are ontologically independent. If Entity were dependent, it would require something more fundamental to depend upon, which contradicts its status as the highest-level category. All other things may be entities, but entities themselves do not require other entities to exist.	
Organization	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Organization	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Sortal (Rigid, supplies identity)	Organization is a rigid property because anything that is an organization is necessarily an organization in all possible worlds where it exists. An organization cannot stop being an organization and become something else while maintaining its identity - if it ceases to be an organization, it ceases to exist as that entity. For example, a company that dissolves doesn't transform into a non-organization; it simply ceases to exist as an organization. The organizational nature is essential to the identity of any instance of Organization throughout its entire existence.	Organization carries an identity condition. Organizations can be distinguished and re-identified through multiple criteria: legal registration numbers, founding documents, organizational structure, and continuity of purpose and membership. An organization maintains its identity even when individual members change, locations shift, or activities evolve. For example, a company remains the same entity despite employee turnover, guided by its legal charter, governance structure, and institutional continuity. Organizations have clear spatio-temporal existence and can be tracked across time through their institutional framework.	Organization supplies its own identity condition. An organization's identity is determined by factors intrinsic to what it means to be an organization - such as its founding charter, legal registration, institutional structure, and continuity of purpose/mission - rather than inheriting identity from a more general category. While organizations are social entities, they establish their own specific criteria for what makes one organization distinct from another (e.g., Google vs Microsoft are different organizations based on their distinct legal entities, governance structures, and institutional identities). This is different from, say, 'Customer' or 'Employee' which would inherit identity from Person, or 'Subsidiary' which might inherit from Organization. Organization itself is the level at which the identity condition for this kind of collective entity is supplied.	Organization is a unifying property. Instances of Organization (e.g., a company, university, or NGO) are intrinsic wholes with integrated parts working toward common purposes. The members, departments, and resources are functionally unified through organizational structure, communication channels, decision-making processes, and shared goals. An organization maintains identity through this integration rather than being a mere collection of people. The parts (employees, divisions) are connected through roles, hierarchies, and workflows that create a cohesive operational whole. This distinguishes organizations from mere groups or collections, as removing or rearranging parts significantly affects the organizational whole's function and identity.	Organization is independent because instances can exist without intrinsically depending on specific other entities. While an organization requires members or participants to be functional, it does not have an essential identity dependence on any particular individual or external entity. Organizations maintain their identity even as members change, and their existence is not contingent upon specific external entities. They are self-sustaining entities with their own identity criteria.	
Agent	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Agent	+R	+I	+O	-U	-D	Sortal (Rigid, supplies identity)	Agent is a rigid property because anything that is an agent (an entity capable of acting, having goals, and exercising some degree of autonomous behavior) is necessarily an agent in all possible worlds where it exists. The capacity for agency is an essential characteristic that defines what it means to be an agent - an entity cannot exist as an agent in some contexts and not in others. While an agent might be inactive or not currently exercising its agency, the potential for agency remains an essential feature. This differs from roles like 'Employee' or phases like 'Active Agent' which can be gained or lost while the entity remains an agent.	Agent carries an identity condition. An agent can be distinguished and re-identified over time through its capacity for intentional action, autonomy, and persistence as a locus of decision-making. Whether the agent is a person, organization, or software system, there are principled ways to distinguish one agent from another and track the same agent through time—for persons through biological/psychological continuity, for organizations through legal/institutional identity, and for software agents through their persistent functional role and system identity. The very concept of agency presupposes an identifiable entity that performs actions and can be held accountable.	Agent supplies its own identity condition. An agent is individuated by its capacity for autonomous action, goal-directed behavior, and causal efficacy in the world. The identity of an agent persists through time based on continuity of agency and causal powers, not inherited from a more general property. Different types of agents (human agents, software agents, organizational agents) may vary in implementation, but the property 'Agent' itself establishes the fundamental identity criterion: what makes this agent the same agent over time is the continuity of its agentive capacities and causal role. This is a global identity condition supplied by the property itself, making it +O.	Agent does not carry unity as an essential characteristic. While many individual agents (like a person or robot) possess intrinsic unity (+U), the concept 'Agent' itself applies to any entity capable of acting or causing effects, regardless of whether it is a unified whole. An agent can be a distributed system (multiple components without strict integration), a collective (a team acting as an agent), or even a loosely coupled organization. Since unity is not necessary for something to qualify as an agent—only the capacity for intentional action or causal efficacy—the property itself is non-unifying (-U).	Agent is independent. An agent (whether a person, organization, software system, or other autonomous entity) can exist without intrinsically depending on other specific entities. While agents may interact with, operate within, or relate to other entities in their environment, they do not require the existence of any particular other entity for their own existence. An agent's defining characteristic is autonomous action and decision-making capacity, which is intrinsic rather than relationally dependent.	
Apple	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Apple	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Sortal (Rigid, supplies identity)	Apple is a rigid property because anything that is an apple is necessarily an apple in all possible worlds throughout its existence. An apple cannot cease to be an apple and become something else while continuing to exist as the same individual - if it transforms significantly (e.g., decays into compost), it ceases to exist as that individual apple. The property 'being an apple' is essential to all its instances from the moment they come into existence until they cease to exist.	Apple carries an identity condition. Each individual apple can be distinguished and re-identified over time through spatio-temporal continuity and physical constitution. We can track a specific apple from when it forms on a tree, through its ripening, harvest, storage, and eventual consumption or decay. Two apples can be differentiated even if they appear identical (same variety, size, color) because they occupy different positions in space and have distinct physical boundaries and internal structure. The identity condition is grounded in the apple being a discrete physical object with clear spatial boundaries and continuous existence through time.	Apple supplies its own identity condition as a physical object. Each apple has its own spatio-temporal continuity and material boundaries that distinguish it from other apples and objects. The identity condition for an apple is intrinsic to being an apple (a distinct physical fruit with continuous existence through time and space), not inherited from a more general category. While Apple is a subkind of Fruit and Physical Object, it provides the specific identity criteria at the level of individual countable fruits.	An apple is a clear example of an intrinsic whole with integrated parts. It has a natural mereological structure (skin, flesh, core, seeds, stem) that are unified through biological organization and functional integration. The parts work together as a single organism/fruit, with natural boundaries that distinguish it from its environment. The apple maintains structural and functional unity - removing arbitrary parts would destroy its nature as an apple, indicating strong internal cohesion rather than arbitrary aggregation.	An apple is a physical object (fruit) that exists independently once it comes into being. While an apple originates from an apple tree during its formation, once it exists as a complete fruit, it does not intrinsically depend on any other specific entity for its continued existence. It maintains its identity as an apple whether attached to the tree, lying on the ground, or placed in storage. The apple's existence is not contingent upon another entity in the way a student depends on an educational institution or a parasite depends on a host.
