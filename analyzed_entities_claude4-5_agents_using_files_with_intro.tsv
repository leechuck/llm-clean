Butterfly	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Butterfly	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Sortal (Rigid, supplies identity)	Butterfly is a rigid property because any entity that is a butterfly is necessarily a butterfly in all possible worlds where it exists. A butterfly cannot cease to be a butterfly and remain the same individual - it is a biological kind that defines the essential nature of its instances. While a caterpillar can transform into a butterfly, this represents a change of identity (a new individual in the strict sense), not the same individual losing the butterfly property. Once something is a butterfly, it remains a butterfly throughout its existence as that individual.	BUTTERFLY carries an identity condition. As a biological organism and living entity, individual butterflies can be distinguished and re-identified through various means including: genetic makeup (DNA), physical characteristics (wing patterns, body structure), and spatio-temporal continuity throughout their lifecycle. Like PERSON, BUTTERFLY is a rigid sortal property - something is a butterfly throughout its existence (from emergence to death), and individual butterflies maintain their identity through time despite changes (wing wear, etc.). The property inherits identity conditions from biological organism categories and supplies sufficient conditions for distinguishing one butterfly from another.	Butterfly supplies its own identity condition as a biological organism. While it carries identity as a living thing, it provides its own specific IC based on biological continuity through metamorphosis - a butterfly maintains identity through its lifecycle stages (egg, larva, pupa, adult) despite dramatic physical transformation. The IC is something like 'having continuous biological existence from the same fertilized egg' or 'maintaining the same DNA and cellular lineage through metamorphosis'. This is distinct from more general biological categories and is specific to the butterfly as an individual organism, making it +O.	A butterfly is an intrinsic whole with a highly integrated mereological structure. Its parts (wings, body segments, antennae, legs) are bound together by both topological connection and functional unity - they form a coherent biological organism where parts work together as an integrated system. The parts are not arbitrary; they are unified by the biological organization of the organism. A butterfly maintains this unity condition throughout its existence as a butterfly (post-metamorphosis). Random collections of butterfly parts or scattered butterfly-colored objects would not constitute a butterfly, demonstrating that instances must be integrated wholes.	A butterfly, once it exists as a butterfly (after metamorphosis), does not intrinsically depend on any other specific external entity for its existence. While butterflies require environmental conditions like air, food sources (nectar), and potentially flowers for survival, these are not constitutive dependencies - a butterfly remains a butterfly whether or not flowers or other entities exist at any given moment. The butterfly is a complete, independent biological organism. This is distinct from roles like PARASITE (which must have a host) or STUDENT (which requires an educational institution). A butterfly is not defined by a necessary relationship to another entity type; it is an autonomous organism that can exist independently, even if only briefly without resources.	
Red	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Red	-R	-I	-O	-U	+D	Attribution (Non-rigid, no identity)	Red is a non-rigid property because entities can gain or lose the property of being red while remaining the same entity. For example, an apple can be green, then become red as it ripens, and remain the same apple throughout. Similarly, a car can be painted red, then repainted blue, while maintaining its identity as the same car. The property is not essential to all its instances across all possible worlds - being red is contingent and changeable for things that are red.	Red is a quality or property that does not carry an identity condition. There is no principled way to distinguish one instance of red from another instance of red, or to re-identify the same instance of redness over time. Red is predicated of objects (e.g., 'this apple is red'), but red itself has no criteria for individuation - we cannot ask 'is this the same red as before?' in a meaningful way without reference to the object that is red. Red is explicitly mentioned in the background text as an example of a -I property, contrasting with sortals like Person or Physical Object that do carry identity conditions.	Red is a quality/attribute that does not supply its own identity condition. As a non-rigid property (things can become red or stop being red), it cannot supply an identity condition according to Definition 6, which requires that only rigid properties can supply ICs. Additionally, Red has already been determined to be -I (does not carry an identity condition), and since +O implies +I, Red must be -O. Red entities are identified by the objects that bear this quality, not by the quality itself.	Red is a quality or attribute that can apply to objects regardless of their mereological structure. Instances of red things can be wholes (a red apple), arbitrary collections (red things on a table), or parts of other objects (the red stripe on a flag). The property Red itself does not impose or carry a unity condition - it is simply a chromatic property that makes no commitment to whether its instances are integrated wholes or scattered aggregates. Red things are not necessarily bound together by any unifying relation beyond sharing the same color property.	Red is a color property (quality/trope) that cannot exist independently. Instances of redness must necessarily inhere in or depend on some concrete entity (a substrate) that bears this color property. A particular instance of red cannot exist without there being something that is red - whether a physical object, surface, or light. This represents external dependence since the red quality depends on entities (colored objects) that are not parts or constituents of the redness itself.	
Food	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Food	-R	-I	-O	-U	-D	Attribution (Non-rigid, no identity)	Food is non-rigid because whether something is food is not essential to that thing across all possible worlds. A particular apple, for instance, can exist as food (when intended for consumption) or not as food (when used as a decorative object or when it rots beyond edibility). The property of being food is not necessarily held by all instances in all circumstances - things can enter and leave the category of food depending on context, condition, and intended use. However, it's not anti-rigid (~R) because some instances might necessarily be food (items created specifically and solely for consumption), though this is not required for all instances.	FOOD does not carry an identity condition. While we can identify specific instances like 'this apple' or 'that sandwich' by referring to them as physical objects with spatio-temporal continuity, FOOD itself as a property does not supply or carry principles for distinguishing one instance of food from another qua food. The identity depends on the material constitution (amount of matter) or the artifact nature (manufactured food item), not on being food per se. There is no principled way to re-identify 'the same food' over time when its material composition changes (e.g., an apple decomposing, or ingredients being mixed into a dish) based solely on the property of being food. FOOD is better understood as a role or functional property that entities can satisfy, rather than a sortal that carries identity conditions.	Food does not supply its own identity condition. As established by the Identity analysis showing Food is -I, it does not carry an identity condition at all, and therefore cannot supply one. Food is a role-like or phase-like property that lacks intrinsic criteria for determining when one instance of food is the same as another. Identity conditions would need to come from more fundamental properties like Physical Object or Amount of Matter that food instances might also instantiate. Since +O requires +I, and Food is -I, Food must be -O.	Food does not carry a common unity condition for all its instances. Instances of Food can be intrinsic wholes (an apple, a chicken), arbitrary portions without inherent boundaries (a serving of rice, some flour), or functional aggregates (a sandwich, a salad). There is no single equivalence relation ω that binds the parts of all Food instances together. An apple has topological and biological unity, while 'some sugar' is merely an arbitrary amount of substance with no intrinsic mereological structure. Since instances can be wholes but lack a uniform UC across all instances, Food is -U rather than ~U.	Food instances can exist as physical objects without intrinsically depending on other specific entities. While food may be defined relationally (as something that can be consumed by organisms), the physical substances that constitute food (fruits, vegetables, meats, etc.) exist independently as material objects. A piece of fruit exists as a physical entity regardless of whether any organism exists to consume it. This is external dependence, not the intrinsic notional dependence required for +D. Unlike PARENT (which cannot be a parent without a child), food items maintain their material existence independently, even if their functional role as 'food' involves a potential relationship to consumers.	
Animal	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Animal	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Sortal (Rigid, supplies identity)	Animal is a rigid property because anything that is an animal is necessarily an animal in all possible worlds throughout its existence. An entity cannot cease to be an animal while continuing to exist as the same individual - the property is essential to the nature of its instances. If something is an animal, it must be an animal in every possible world where it exists, making this a necessary property for all its instances.	ANIMAL carries an identity condition. As a rigid natural kind, animals can be distinguished and re-identified through various criteria including genetic makeup (DNA), continuous biological processes, and spatio-temporal continuity of their physical body. Each animal instance maintains identity through change (growth, cell replacement) via biological continuity. For example, a cat remains the same individual cat throughout its life despite losing fur, growing, or other changes, because it maintains biological and physical continuity. This makes ANIMAL a sortal property that carries (and likely supplies) an IC.	Animal supplies its own identity condition. As a rigid natural kind, it provides fundamental criteria for distinguishing one animal from another across time - such as biological continuity, genetic identity, or spatiotemporal continuity of the living organism. While specific subtypes like Dog or Cat may inherit and specialize this IC, Animal itself establishes the basic identity conditions for all its instances as distinct living organisms. It does not merely inherit its IC from more general properties like Physical Object (which would have different, incompatible ICs based on mereological considerations), but rather supplies biological-based identity conditions appropriate to living organisms.	Animal carries a unity condition (+U). All instances of Animal are intrinsic wholes with clear mereological structure based on biological unity. The parts of an animal (organs, tissues, cells) are bound together by biological functions and topological connection, forming an integrated organism. An animal maintains this unity condition throughout its existence - it cannot cease to be a biological whole while remaining an animal. The parts are not arbitrary aggregates but functionally and topologically integrated components. This satisfies Definition 11, as there exists an equivalence relation (biological functional integration) under which all animal instances are intrinsic wholes.	Animal is independent because instances of Animal do not intrinsically depend on other entities external to themselves for their existence. While animals may depend on food, water, or oxygen as general resources, these are not specific entities that constitute an external notional dependence. An animal exists as a self-sufficient organism without necessarily requiring specific other entities (like a parent requires a child, or a student requires an educational institution). Animals have constituent parts (organs, cells) but these are internal, not external dependencies. The property Animal does not require that some instance of another property must necessarily exist that is not a part or constituent of the animal itself.	
RedApple	http://example.org/guarino-messy#RedApple	-R	+I	-O	+U	-D	Category or Mixin (Non-rigid)	RedApple is non-rigid because being a red apple is not essential to all its instances throughout their existence. An apple can lose the property of being red (e.g., through ripening from green to red, or rotting and changing color) while remaining the same individual apple. The property 'red' is an accidental property that can change over time, making RedApple a non-rigid property. An instance can cease to be a RedApple without ceasing to exist as that particular individual.	RedApple carries an identity condition inherited from its parent property APPLE, which is a kind of PHYSICAL OBJECT. Physical objects carry identity conditions based on spatio-temporal continuity - we can track and re-identify a specific red apple over time through its location and temporal trajectory, even as it may change color or lose parts. While RED itself does not carry identity (-I), the combination RedApple is a sortal property that inherits the identity condition from APPLE/PHYSICAL OBJECT, allowing us to distinguish one red apple from another and re-identify the same red apple at different times.	RedApple does not supply its own identity condition. As a property that combines color (Red) with a kind (Apple), it inherits its identity condition from Apple, which in turn likely inherits from more general rigid properties like PhysicalObject or Fruit. The 'red' aspect is an accidental property that does not contribute to establishing what makes a particular red apple the same individual over time - the identity condition comes from it being an apple (a physical object with mereological and spatiotemporal continuity). RedApple carries an IC (+I) but does not supply it.	RedApple inherits the unity condition from Apple, which is a biological organism with integrated parts (skin, flesh, seeds, stem) bound together by biological and topological connections. Each red apple instance is an intrinsic whole with clear mereological structure - its parts (core, flesh, skin) form a unified object through both topological connection and functional/biological integration. The 'red' modifier does not affect this unity condition, as it merely restricts the instances to those apples that are red while maintaining the same mereological structure.	RedApple represents a physical object (an apple with the quality of being red) that exists independently without necessarily requiring other specific entities for its existence. While an apple may have various relationships (grown on a tree, eaten by someone, etc.), these are not intrinsic dependencies - a red apple can exist as a complete entity without depending on any other particular entity. The redness is a quality inherent to the apple itself, and the apple as a physical object maintains its existence independently, unlike examples such as Student (which requires an educational institution) or Parent (which requires a child).	
Group	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Group	+R	+I	+O	~U	+D	Sortal (Rigid, supplies identity)	Group is a rigid property because anything that is a group is necessarily a group in all possible worlds where it exists. A group is defined by its nature as a collection or aggregate of entities. While the membership of a group can change over time (members can join or leave), and a group can cease to exist entirely, when something IS a group, it is essentially a group - it cannot be the same entity while not being a group. The identity of a group persists through membership changes (like a band that replaces members), but what makes it a group rather than, say, a single individual or a mere set, is an essential characteristic. This differs from anti-rigid properties like 'Student' or 'Employee' where the same entity (a person) can cease to have that property while remaining the same entity.	Group carries an identity condition. A group can be distinguished and re-identified over time through its membership composition and organizational structure. For example, 'The Beatles' remains identifiable as the same group despite changes in circumstances, and different groups can be distinguished by their distinct membership. While the specific identity criterion may vary by context (e.g., formal groups may have registration numbers, informal groups may be identified by their member set at formation), groups do carry necessary conditions for identity - typically based on some combination of founding membership, continuity of purpose, or organizational continuity. This makes Group a sortal property (+I), even though it may inherit rather than supply its own identity condition.	Group supplies its own identity condition. A group is identified by its membership composition - having the same members constitutes identity for groups. This is a distinct identity criterion from other sortals: two groups are the same group if and only if they have exactly the same members. This IC is supplied by GROUP itself, not inherited from a more general property, as GROUP represents a fundamental way of organizing entities into collections. The membership-based identity criterion is specific to groups and differentiates them from other collective entities or sets.	Group is a paradigmatic example of anti-unity (~U). Its instances are collections of entities that lack intrinsic integration - the parts (members) are not bound together by any unifying relation that makes them a genuine whole. A group is merely an aggregate or plurality where membership is the only relevant relation, not topological connection, morphological unity, or functional integration. The members of a group remain separate entities without mereological integration. This is precisely why Group exemplifies anti-unity in the ontological framework - it represents scattered, non-integrated collections rather than unified wholes.	A Group is externally dependent on its members. By definition, a group cannot exist without having members (instances of some other entity like Person, Organization, etc.). The group is not constituted by its members in the mereological sense (the members are not parts that compose the group), but the group necessarily requires the existence of entities that are not parts of itself - namely, the entities that are its members. This fits the definition of external notional dependence: for any instance of Group, there must necessarily exist instances of some other property (e.g., Member, Person) that are external to the group itself.	
Country	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Country	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Sortal (Rigid, supplies identity)	Country is a rigid property because anything that is a country is necessarily a country in all possible worlds where it exists. While a geographic region might gain or lose the status of being a country over time (e.g., through independence or dissolution), when we refer to a specific country entity, we are referring to something that is essentially a country. The entity 'France' or 'Japan' cannot cease to be a country and remain the same entity - if the political entity dissolves, that particular country ceases to exist rather than transitioning to something else. This is different from non-rigid properties like 'Independent Nation' (which a country could lose while the geographic/political entity persists in some form). Country represents a sortal that provides identity conditions for its instances throughout their existence.	COUNTRY carries an identity condition. Countries can be distinguished and re-identified over time through various criteria: geographical boundaries (territorial extent), sovereign governmental authority, international recognition, and legal status in international law. A country maintains its identity even when its government changes, population shifts, or minor border adjustments occur. For example, France remains the same country despite changes in leadership, population, and even some territorial modifications. The identity condition could be formulated as 'having the same sovereign territorial jurisdiction' or 'being recognized as the same state entity in international law'. This allows us to track and re-identify a country both synchronically (distinguishing France from Germany at time t) and diachronically (recognizing that France at t1 is the same country as France at t2).	Country supplies its own identity condition. A country has global identity criteria that are not inherited from more general properties - such as having the same territory, sovereignty, government, and international recognition. These identity conditions are specific to what makes a country the same country over time (e.g., France remains France despite government changes, as long as it maintains its essential geopolitical identity). Country does not merely inherit its IC from a more general property like 'Political Entity' or 'Geographical Region', but rather establishes the fundamental criteria for country-identity itself.	Country carries a unity condition as its instances are intrinsic wholes with integrated parts bound together by political, legal, and administrative relations. A country like France or Japan has parts (regions, territories) that are unified through governmental authority, legal jurisdiction, and sovereignty - these parts are bound together by the relation of 'being under the same sovereign political system' and nothing else falls under that specific sovereignty. The borders define what is maximally connected under this political-legal relation, making each country instance a functional and institutional whole with clear mereological structure. The unity is based on political-legal functional relations that persist throughout the country's existence.	Country is independent (-D). A country's existence as a geopolitical entity does not intrinsically depend on other specific entities. While countries exist within an international system and have relationships with other countries, citizens, governments, and territories, none of these are external dependencies in the ontological sense defined. The territory, government, and population are constituents or parts of what makes a country, not external entities it depends upon. A country can exist (at least conceptually) as a sovereign entity without necessarily requiring specific other countries to exist, unlike cases such as PARENT (which requires CHILD) or STUDENT (which requires SCHOOL). The country itself is the fundamental geopolitical unit, not dependent on external entities for its existence.	
AmountOfMatter	http://example.org/guarino-messy#AmountOfMatter	+R	-I	-O	~U	-D	Attribution or Quality	AmountOfMatter is a rigid property because anything that is an amount of matter is necessarily so in all possible worlds. An amount of matter cannot cease to be an amount of matter while remaining the same entity - it would either continue to exist as that same amount of matter or cease to exist entirely. The property is essential to its identity through mereological extensionality (having the same parts). This is explicitly referenced in the background text where AMOUNT OF MATTER is discussed as having mereological extensionality as its identity criterion, making it fundamentally rigid.	AmountOfMatter does not carry an identity condition. As explicitly mentioned in the background text, amounts of matter follow mereological extensionality - they are defined purely by their parts. If any part changes, it becomes a different amount of matter. There is no principled way to re-identify an amount of matter over time if its composition changes, as the identity is tied entirely to the specific collection of parts at a given moment. The text directly uses 'AMOUNT OF MATTER' as an example of a property that lacks identity conditions, contrasting it with PERSON which can maintain identity despite replacing parts.	Since AmountOfMatter was determined to be -I (does not carry identity), it cannot supply its own identity condition. The constraint states that +O implies +I, so -I necessarily means -O. AmountOfMatter does not supply an identity condition - it may not have a clear identity criterion at all, or any identity it has would need to be inherited from a more specific rigid property (which it currently lacks).	AmountOfMatter is explicitly cited in the source text as a canonical example of anti-unity (~U). Amounts of matter are portions or quantities of substance without any intrinsic principle of unity binding their parts together. An amount of matter persists through arbitrary division and recombination - if you split an amount of water into two parts, you simply have two amounts of water, with no violation of identity. The parts of an amount of matter are not integrated by any equivalence relation (topological, morphological, or functional); they form mere aggregates or sums. The text states: 'Amount of Matter is usually an example of the latter kind, since none of its instances can be intrinsic wholes.' This contrasts sharply with properties like Vase, where instances must maintain specific unity conditions (shape, functional integration) to remain the same vase.	AmountOfMatter is independent (-D) because instances of amounts of matter can exist without necessarily depending on other entities external to themselves. An amount of matter (e.g., a lump of clay, a quantity of water, a pile of sand) exists as a collection of physical substance that does not intrinsically require the existence of any other specific entity beyond its constituent parts. While an amount of matter may be part of or constitute other things (like a physical object), it does not externally depend on those things for its existence - rather, those things may depend on it. The matter itself can exist independently as mere stuff, requiring only its own constituent material parts, which are not external dependencies in the sense of notional dependence.	
PhysicalObject	http://example.org/guarino-messy#PhysicalObject	+R	+I	+O	-U	-D	Sortal (Rigid, supplies identity)	PhysicalObject is a rigid property because anything that is a physical object is necessarily a physical object in all possible worlds. An entity cannot cease to be a physical object while remaining the same entity - it would be a fundamental change in the nature of what the entity is. If something exists as a physical object, this is an essential property that holds across all possible worlds for that instance. This is similar to the example of PERSON given in the background text as a paradigmatic case of rigidity.	PhysicalObject carries an identity condition based on spatio-temporal continuity. Physical objects can be distinguished and re-identified across time through their continuous spatio-temporal trajectory. Even as a physical object may change some properties (location, temperature, etc.), it maintains identity through its material constitution and spatio-temporal path. This allows us to re-identify 'the same' physical object at different times, satisfying the requirement for an identity condition. The IC is something like 'occupying the same continuous spatio-temporal region' or 'having the same material continuity.' This makes PhysicalObject a sortal property.	PhysicalObject supplies its own identity condition based on spatio-temporal continuity and material composition. As a fundamental rigid property, it provides the global identity criterion that distinguishes one physical object from another across time - typically through continuous occupation of space-time and material constitution. This IC is not inherited from a more general property but is supplied by PhysicalObject itself, making it a foundational sortal that establishes identity conditions for all physical entities.	PhysicalObject does not carry a common unity condition for all its instances. While many physical objects are intrinsic wholes (e.g., a person, a car, a rock), others are arbitrary aggregates (e.g., a pile of sand, a scattered collection of pebbles, a cloud of gas). The property encompasses both integrated wholes with functional/topological unity and mere aggregates without intrinsic unity criteria. Since there is no single equivalence relation ω that makes all instances of PhysicalObject intrinsic wholes, it is -U rather than +U. It is not ~U because some instances (like organisms or artifacts) clearly are intrinsic wholes, just not all of them under a common unity condition.	PhysicalObject is independent (-D) because instances of physical objects can exist without necessarily depending on other specific entities for their existence. A physical object like a rock, tree, or molecule exists by virtue of its physical nature and does not intrinsically require the existence of other distinct entities (beyond its constituent parts, which are excluded from external dependence). Unlike dependent entities such as Parent (which requires Child) or Student (which requires School), a physical object's existence is not contingent upon relationships with external entities. Physical objects may causally interact with or be affected by other entities, but they do not have the kind of essential, notional dependence that characterizes +D properties.	
GroupOfPeople	http://example.org/guarino-messy#GroupOfPeople	-R	+I	+O	~U	+D	Category or Mixin (Non-rigid)	GroupOfPeople is non-rigid because while a collection of people constitutes a group at a given time, the same entity can cease to be a group of people (e.g., when members leave and it becomes empty, or when its composition changes such that it no longer qualifies as a 'group'). An entity can be a GroupOfPeople at time t1 and not be a GroupOfPeople at time t2, while remaining the same entity. This is not anti-rigid (~R) because not ALL instances must possibly not be groups - some groups could theoretically exist necessarily as groups in certain conceptualizations. Therefore, it is non-rigid (-R) as it is not essential to all its instances in all possible worlds.	GroupOfPeople carries an identity condition. A group can be distinguished and re-identified through its membership composition at any given time. Two groups are the same if and only if they have the same members (or the same defining criterion for membership). For example, 'The Beatles' can be identified by its specific members (John, Paul, George, Ringo), and we can determine whether two references point to the same group. Even if membership changes over time (dynamic groups), there exists a criterion (e.g., organizational continuity, founding charter, or institutional identity) that allows us to track the group's identity diachronically. The identity condition may be: 'having the same members at time t' (synchronic) or 'having continuity through the same organizational structure/purpose' (diachronic).	GroupOfPeople supplies its own identity condition based on group membership composition. The identity of a group is determined by which specific people constitute that group - two groups are the same if and only if they consist of the same members. This is distinct from and not inherited from more general properties. While groups are collections, they supply their own IC based on their constituent members: having-the-same-members serves as the identity criterion. This makes GroupOfPeople a property that supplies (+O) rather than merely carries an identity condition.	GroupOfPeople is anti-unity (~U) because its instances are strictly aggregates of persons without intrinsic mereological integration. A group has no unity condition (UC) that binds its members together as an intrinsic whole - the people in a group remain distinct, independently existing individuals. The membership is arbitrary and contingent; members can be added or removed without affecting the identity of the constituent persons. Unlike a Person (which is +U with integrated biological parts bound by functional/topological unity), a GroupOfPeople is merely a collection where the 'parts' (individual people) maintain their own separate unity conditions and existence. This exemplifies the classic case of an aggregate or plurality rather than an integrated whole.	GroupOfPeople is externally dependent because any instance of a group necessarily requires the existence of Person instances that are members of the group. A group cannot exist without people to constitute it, and these people are not parts or constituents of the group itself in the mereological sense - they are separate entities that the group depends upon. The group's existence is predicated on having members, making it externally dependent on Person (or people).	
LivingBeing	http://example.org/guarino-messy#LivingBeing	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Sortal (Rigid, supplies identity)	LivingBeing is a rigid property because anything that is a living being is necessarily a living being in all possible worlds where it exists. An entity cannot cease to be a living being and remain the same entity - when something dies, it becomes a corpse or remains, which is a fundamentally different kind of entity (no longer a living being but dead matter). The property of being alive is essential to the identity of living beings; a living being cannot lose this property and continue to exist as the same individual. This is distinct from contingent properties like being a student or being red, which can change while the entity persists.	LivingBeing carries an identity condition. Living beings can be distinguished and re-identified over time through biological continuity criteria such as continuous biological processes, genetic makeup, and organizational structure that persists despite metabolic changes. Even though living beings constantly exchange matter with their environment and replace their parts, they maintain identity through continuous life processes and biological organization. This makes LivingBeing a sortal property that provides principled ways to individuate and track instances across time, distinguishing one living being from another and recognizing the same living being at different temporal points despite physical changes.	LivingBeing supplies its own identity condition based on biological continuity and organizational structure. A living being maintains identity through continuous metabolic processes, self-organization, and persistence of biological structure despite material replacement. The IC 'having continuous biological organization and life processes' is specific to LivingBeing and not inherited from a more general property - it is what distinguishes living entities from non-living physical objects. This biological IC is fundamentally different from purely physical ICs (like spatio-temporal continuity for physical objects), making LivingBeing +O.	LivingBeing carries a unity condition (+U) because all instances are intrinsic wholes with clear mereological structure. Living beings maintain topological unity through their physical boundaries (cell membranes, skin) and functional unity through integrated biological systems (circulatory, nervous, respiratory systems). The parts of a living being (organs, cells, tissues) are bound together by biological functions and cannot be arbitrarily selected - they form a maximally self-connected whole under biological organization. Whether single-celled organisms or complex multicellular entities, all living beings satisfy the condition of being intrinsic wholes throughout their existence, with parts that are functionally and topologically integrated into a unified organism.	LivingBeing is independent (-D). While living beings have biological dependencies (oxygen, nutrients, environment), they do not exhibit external notional dependence as defined in the framework. External dependence requires that instances necessarily depend on other discrete entities that are not parts or constituents of them. A living being's existence is not intrinsically dependent on the necessary existence of some other specific entity outside itself - it can exist as a self-contained organism. The biological requirements are not the kind of notional dependence meant here, which is exemplified by cases like PARENT depending on CHILD (cannot be a parent without a child existing as a separate entity). LivingBeing has no such external entity requirement for its basic existence.	
SocialEntity	http://example.org/guarino-messy#SocialEntity	+R	+I	+O	-U	-D	Sortal (Rigid, supplies identity)	SocialEntity is rigid because anything that is a social entity is necessarily a social entity in all possible worlds where it exists. Social entities (such as organizations, institutions, communities, or collective agents) maintain their nature as social constructs throughout their existence. An entity cannot be a social entity at one time and not a social entity at another while remaining the same entity - if something is constituted by social relations and collective intentionality, this is an essential characteristic. While specific instances may change their properties (an organization may change its structure), they cannot cease being social entities without ceasing to exist as that particular entity. This is similar to how Person is rigid - just as a person cannot cease being a person while continuing to exist as the same individual, a social entity cannot cease being a social entity while continuing to exist as that same social entity.	SocialEntity carries an identity condition. Social entities (organizations, institutions, groups, etc.) have principled ways to distinguish and re-identify instances over time. For example, a corporation can be identified by its legal registration, charter documents, and continuity of legal personhood; a family can be identified by its specific set of relationships and lineage; a club maintains identity through its membership structure and institutional continuity. While SocialEntity itself may not supply its own IC (as it's likely too general), it inherits ICs from more specific rigid properties that subsume it or is itself subsumed by properties that carry ICs. Social entities persist through changes in membership, location, and other properties, but maintain identity through institutional, legal, or social continuity criteria. This distinguishes them from properties like 'Red' or 'Amount of Matter' which lack such criteria.	SocialEntity supplies its own identity condition. Social entities (organizations, groups, institutions) have identity conditions based on social/institutional facts - such as legal registration, founding documents, or collective recognition - that are distinct from the identity conditions of their physical or biological constituents. For example, a company maintains its identity through legal incorporation and continuity of institutional structure, not through the identity of its employees or physical assets. This IC is fundamentally different from and not inherited from more general properties like Physical Object or Person, making SocialEntity a supplier of its own identity condition.	SocialEntity does not carry a common unity condition for all its instances. While some social entities like organizations or institutions may have functional unity through their constituent members and relationships, others like social networks or communities may have looser, more arbitrary boundaries. Additionally, different types of social entities (corporations, marriages, clubs, casual social groups) would require different unity conditions - some having clear mereological structure with integrated parts (e.g., a corporation with departments and employees), while others being more loosely connected collections (e.g., a demographic category or social class). Since there is no single equivalence relation omega that makes all instances intrinsic wholes, SocialEntity is -U rather than +U. It is not ~U because some of its instances (like formal organizations) can indeed be intrinsic wholes with functional unity.	SocialEntity represents a broad category encompassing social constructs, organizations, groups, and collective entities. While specific subtypes of social entities (like Student, Employee, or Member) may be externally dependent on other entities, the general property SocialEntity itself does not inherently require instances to depend on specific external entities that are not parts or constituents of them. A social entity like a community, organization, or social group can exist as a whole without necessarily depending on external entities beyond its constituent members. The members or constituent elements are parts of the social entity rather than external dependencies. Therefore, SocialEntity as a general category carries -D (Independent).	
Location	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Location	+R	-I	-O	-U	-D	Attribution or Quality	Location is rigid because anything that is a location is necessarily a location in all possible worlds. A spatial region or place does not cease to be a location - it cannot gain or lose the property of being a location while remaining the same entity. For example, if Paris is a location, it must be a location in every possible world where it exists. This is distinct from being 'at a location' (which would be anti-rigid), but the property of being a location itself is essential to its instances.	Location does not carry an identity condition. While we can refer to locations through coordinates or names, location itself as a property does not provide intrinsic criteria for distinguishing one location from another over time. Locations are better understood as abstract regions or positions that things occupy, rather than as sortals with their own identity conditions. The identity of what occupies a location (e.g., a place, a region, a physical object) would be supplied by other properties. Location functions more as a relational or attributive property rather than a sortal that carries identity criteria for its instances.	Location does not supply its own identity condition. As determined in the Identity analysis, Location is -I (does not carry identity). Since +O requires +I (a property cannot supply an identity condition without carrying one), Location must be -O. Location is a non-sortal property that cannot provide criteria for distinguishing one location from another - there is no universal identity condition for 'locations' as such. More specific spatial properties (like Geographic Region, Address, or Coordinate Point) would need to supply their own identity conditions based on their particular nature (e.g., GPS coordinates, postal codes, geographic boundaries).	Location does not carry a common unity condition for all its instances. While some locations may have clear spatial boundaries and unity (e.g., a room, a building), others are arbitrary regions without intrinsic wholeness (e.g., 'within 5 miles of downtown', 'the area between two cities'). Different types of locations have incompatible or absent unity conditions - a geographic region defined by political boundaries has different unity criteria than a physical container, and abstract coordinate-based locations may have no unity at all. Since there is no single equivalence relation omega that makes all instances of Location intrinsic wholes, Location is -U rather than +U, though it is not ~U because some specific locations can be wholes.	Location is externally independent. A location can exist as a spatial region or place without necessarily depending on other entities external to it. While locations may contain objects or be related to other locations, they do not intrinsically require the existence of any specific external entity to exist as spatial positions or regions. The space itself can exist independently, even if empty or unoccupied. Unlike PARENT (which requires CHILD) or STUDENT (which requires SCHOOL), a location does not have a necessary existential dependence on entities outside of itself.	
Fruit	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Fruit	-R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Category or Mixin (Non-rigid)	Fruit is non-rigid because while something is a fruit at a given time, it is not necessarily a fruit in all possible states or times. A botanical fruit (e.g., an apple) necessarily exists first as a flower/ovary, then develops into a fruit, and later may decay into organic matter. The same entity can exist without being a fruit - it was once part of a flower, and the matter that constitutes it will persist after it ceases to be recognizable as a fruit. An instance can gain the property of being a fruit (through development) and lose it (through consumption, decay, or transformation), meaning being a fruit is not essential to the entity's identity across all possible worlds.	Fruit carries an identity condition. Each individual fruit (e.g., a specific apple, orange, or banana) can be distinguished and re-identified through spatio-temporal continuity as a discrete physical object. A particular apple remains the same apple over time through its continuous existence in space-time, even as it undergoes changes like ripening or minor damage. Fruit is a sortal that inherits identity conditions from broader properties like Physical Object, which supply criteria based on spatio-temporal location and material continuity. We can meaningfully ask 'Is this the same fruit I saw yesterday?' and answer based on tracking its continuous existence.	Fruit supplies its own identity condition as a biological entity. A fruit maintains identity through its developmental origin (derived from the ovary of a flower after fertilization) and its continuous existence as a discrete botanical structure. Unlike properties such as 'Red Fruit' or 'Ripe Fruit' which would inherit identity from Fruit, the property Fruit itself establishes the fundamental IC for distinguishing one fruit from another based on biological origin and physical continuity. As a natural kind with rigid essence (a fruit remains a fruit throughout its existence from formation to decomposition), it supplies rather than merely inherits its identity condition.	A fruit is an intrinsic whole with a clear mereological structure and unity condition based on biological and functional integration. All parts of a fruit (skin, flesh, seeds, stem) are topologically and functionally connected as a single biological entity that develops as an integrated whole from a flower's ovary. The parts are bound together through biological processes and serve the unified functional purpose of seed protection and dispersal. A fruit maintains its unity condition throughout its existence - an apple remains a unified whole apple even as it ripens or deteriorates, and arbitrary divisions destroy its identity as a fruit. This distinguishes it from mere aggregates like 'amount of matter' or collections of fruits.	Fruit instances do not exhibit external dependence on other entities. Once a fruit exists as a distinct entity (after developing on a plant), it can continue to exist independently without necessarily requiring the continued existence of any other specific entity that is not a part or constituent of it. While fruits originate from plants, the mature fruit itself is not existentially dependent on the plant continuing to exist - it can exist separately (e.g., after being harvested). The fruit's parts (seeds, flesh, skin) are constituents of the fruit itself, not external entities. Therefore, Fruit does not satisfy the criterion for +D, which requires that instances necessarily depend on some other entity that is neither a part nor a constituent of them.	
Vertebrate	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Vertebrate	+R	+I	-O	+U	-D	Sortal (Rigid, carries identity)	Vertebrate is a rigid property because it denotes a biological classification based on the presence of a vertebral column (backbone). Any entity that is a vertebrate possesses this fundamental anatomical feature essentially - it cannot cease to be a vertebrate while remaining the same individual. A vertebrate animal cannot lose its vertebral column structure and continue existing as the same organism without that defining characteristic. This is necessarily true across all possible worlds where that individual exists, making it an essential property rather than a contingent or phase-dependent one.	Vertebrate carries an identity condition. As a biological kind that subsumes rigid properties like specific species (e.g., Mammal, Bird, Fish), vertebrates inherit identity conditions from their biological nature. Individual vertebrates can be distinguished and re-identified through characteristics such as DNA, spatio-temporal continuity, and unique biological markers. While Vertebrate itself may not supply the IC (it may be inherited from more fundamental properties like Organism or Living Being), it clearly carries an IC that allows us to distinguish one vertebrate individual from another and track it through time. This satisfies the definition of +I: being subsumed by or being a rigid property that carries an identity condition.	Vertebrate does not supply its own identity condition. As a biological kind, it inherits its identity condition from more general properties like Animal or Organism. The identity of a vertebrate is determined by being the same organism over time (with biological continuity as the IC), not by having a vertebral column. The vertebral column is a distinguishing characteristic that defines membership in the class, but not what makes one vertebrate identical to itself over time versus another vertebrate. The IC comes from the more general biological sortal it instantiates.	Vertebrate carries a unity condition. All instances of Vertebrate are intrinsic wholes with clear mereological structure bound by both topological and functional unity. The defining characteristic (possession of a vertebral column/backbone) itself implies an integrated biological system where parts are functionally connected through anatomical, physiological, and developmental relations. Each vertebrate organism maintains its wholeness throughout existence - the parts (organs, skeletal structure, nervous system) are bound together by biological relations that distinguish them from the rest of the world. A vertebrate cannot exist as a scattered or arbitrary collection of parts; it must be an integrated living organism with coordinated biological functions.	Vertebrate is a biological classification that denotes organisms possessing a spinal column. Instances of Vertebrate (such as mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians) are independent entities that do not intrinsically depend on other external entities for their existence as vertebrates. While vertebrates may have various ecological relationships (predator-prey, symbiosis, etc.) and biological dependencies (food sources, oxygen), these are not the kind of notional dependence that would make Vertebrate carry +D. A vertebrate can exist as a vertebrate without necessarily requiring some other specific entity to exist externally. The property Vertebrate itself is defined by intrinsic anatomical characteristics (having a backbone) rather than by a necessary relationship to another entity. This is analogous to Person being -D - while persons may need food, water, and air, they don't depend on a specific external entity type for their identity as persons.	
Caterpillar	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Caterpillar	~R	+I	-O	+U	-D	Role or Phase (Anti-rigid)	Caterpillar is anti-rigid because it represents a temporary phase in the life cycle of certain insects (butterflies and moths). Any instance of Caterpillar necessarily exists as a caterpillar only temporarily - it is essential to the nature of being a caterpillar that the entity will transform into a different form (chrysalis/pupa, then adult butterfly/moth). No entity can be a caterpillar in all possible worlds while remaining the same individual, as caterpillars by definition undergo metamorphosis. This makes it a phase sortal rather than a substance sortal, carrying the anti-rigid property ~R.	CATERPILLAR carries an identity condition. As a life stage of a lepidopteran organism, a caterpillar can be distinguished and re-identified through biological continuity - it maintains identity through spatio-temporal continuity and biological processes. Each caterpillar instance has determinate boundaries (its physical body), continuous existence through time, and can be tracked as the same individual even as it grows and changes. The identity condition is inherited from broader biological sortals like ORGANISM or ANIMAL, which supply identity criteria based on biological continuity. While CATERPILLAR is a phase sortal (non-rigid, as the same organism stops being a caterpillar when it metamorphoses), it still carries the identity condition from its subsuming rigid properties.	Caterpillar does not supply its own identity condition. While it carries an identity condition (+I) as a biological organism, that identity condition is supplied by more fundamental properties like ORGANISM or ANIMAL. A caterpillar's identity through time (remaining the same individual caterpillar as it grows and molts) follows from biological organism identity principles, not from any unique identity criteria specific to being a caterpillar. The property inherits its IC from its subsuming rigid properties rather than supplying a novel one.	A caterpillar is a biological organism with an integrated body structure where parts (segments, organs, appendages) are bound together by both topological and functional unity relations. All parts of a caterpillar are connected through biological tissue and function as a coordinated living system. The organism maintains its unity throughout its existence as a caterpillar - it is an intrinsic whole under biological/topological connection. Unlike arbitrary collections or scattered objects, a caterpillar has clear boundaries and maximal self-connectedness, with each part necessarily connected to all other parts and nothing else, satisfying the formal definition of carrying a unity condition.	A caterpillar is an independent biological entity that exists as a complete organism in its own right. While it is a larval stage of a butterfly or moth, during its existence as a caterpillar, it does not depend on any external entity (beyond general environmental requirements like food and habitat that all organisms need). The caterpillar itself is not relationally defined - it is not intrinsically dependent on another specific entity for its existence or identity. It is a self-contained organism with its own biological functions, unlike dependent entities such as PARENT (which requires a CHILD) or EMPLOYEE (which requires an EMPLOYER). The fact that it will metamorphose into an adult insect is a temporal process, not an external dependence relationship.	
Person	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Person	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Sortal (Rigid, supplies identity)	Person is a rigid property because if an entity is a person, it is necessarily a person in all possible worlds and at all times. An entity cannot cease to be a person while remaining the same entity - personhood is an essential property. A person cannot become a non-person or vice versa without ceasing to exist as the same individual. This is a paradigmatic example of a rigid property, as explicitly mentioned in the background text.	Person clearly carries an identity condition. Multiple identity criteria can distinguish and re-identify person instances over time, including biological markers (DNA, fingerprints, retinal patterns), social identifiers (SSN), and spatio-temporal continuity of a living organism. These provide both necessary and sufficient conditions for determining whether x at time t is the same person as y at time t'. Person is a paradigmatic example of a sortal property that supplies its own identity condition (+O), making it inherently +I.	Person supplies its own identity condition. As a fundamental rigid sortal, Person provides global identity criteria such as 'having the same SSN' or 'having the same fingerprints' that allow for reidentification of the same person across time and through change. Person does not merely inherit its identity condition from a more general property - it establishes its own identity criteria that can then be inherited by more specific properties like Student, Employee, etc. This is a paradigmatic case of a property that supplies (+O) rather than merely carries (+I) an identity condition.	Person carries a unity condition (+U) because every instance is an intrinsic whole with integrated parts bound by biological and functional relations. A person's parts (organs, limbs, cells) are connected through physiological processes, forming a maximal self-connected system under topological and functional unity relations. The biological integration persists throughout the person's existence - you cannot arbitrarily add or remove parts while maintaining personhood. The parts work together as a unified organism, not as a mere aggregate or scattered collection.	Person is independent (-D) because instances of Person can exist without intrinsically depending on other specific entities external to themselves. While persons may have social relationships (parents, children, friends) and require environmental conditions (oxygen, food) for biological survival, these are not ontological dependencies that define what it means to be a person. A person's existence as a person does not necessarily require the existence of any other specific external entity. This contrasts with properties like Parent (which requires a Child) or Student (which requires an Educational Institution), where the very definition of being an instance requires another entity to exist.	
LegalAgent	http://example.org/guarino-messy#LegalAgent	~R	+I	+O	-U	-D	Role or Phase (Anti-rigid)	LegalAgent is anti-rigid because it represents a role or status that entities acquire within a legal system. An entity (whether a person or organization) becomes a legal agent by gaining legal recognition and capacity, and can potentially cease to be a legal agent (e.g., through death, dissolution, or loss of legal capacity). The property is contingent - entities are not necessarily legal agents in all possible worlds, and all instances of LegalAgent could possibly not be legal agents. This is characteristic of roles and institutional statuses, which are paradigmatic cases of anti-rigid properties.	LegalAgent carries an identity condition. Legal agents can be distinguished and re-identified through formal legal mechanisms such as legal registration numbers, incorporation documents, tax identification numbers, or other legally recognized identifiers. Whether the legal agent is a natural person (with biometric/documentary identity) or a juridical person like a corporation (with registration numbers and legal documents), there exist necessary and sufficient conditions to determine if two instances of LegalAgent are the same entity across time. Legal systems explicitly provide frameworks for establishing and maintaining the identity of legal agents, making this a clear case of +I.	LegalAgent supplies its own identity condition as it establishes a new ontological category with its own criteria for identity - legal personhood and legal capacity. Legal agents are identified by their legal status and rights/responsibilities within a legal system (e.g., legal registration, jurisdiction-specific identifiers), which is distinct from and not reducible to the identity conditions of more general properties like Agent or Entity. This is a rigid property that introduces its own way of tracking identity through legal frameworks, making it +O.	LegalAgent does not carry a common unity condition for all its instances. While all instances are intrinsic wholes (persons have biological unity, organizations have functional/legal unity), there is no single equivalence relation ω that applies to all legal agents. A person's unity is based on biological integration, while a corporation's unity is based on functional and legal relationships among its members. Since different subtypes have incompatible unity conditions, LegalAgent itself cannot carry +U. However, it's not ~U because its instances ARE intrinsic wholes - they just have different unity conditions. Therefore, LegalAgent is -U: it doesn't carry a unity condition, but doesn't anti-carry it either.	LegalAgent refers to entities capable of entering into legal relations, contracts, and bearing legal rights and responsibilities. This includes persons, corporations, and other entities recognized by law. While a LegalAgent operates within a legal system, the entity itself (whether a person or organization) does not intrinsically depend on other specific entities for its existence. A person exists as a person regardless of their legal agency status, and an organization exists as an organizational entity. The legal recognition is a quality or status conferred upon the entity, but the entity's existence is independent. The legal system is a framework that recognizes the entity, not something the entity existentially depends upon. Therefore, LegalAgent carries -D (Independent).	
Entity	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Entity	+R	+I	+O	-U	-D	Sortal (Rigid, supplies identity)	Entity is the most general category that encompasses everything that exists or can exist. Anything that is an entity is necessarily an entity in all possible worlds - there is no conceivable scenario where something could cease to be an entity while continuing to exist. Entity represents the fundamental ontological commitment of being something rather than nothing, making it an essential and rigid property for all its instances.	Entity is a fundamental sortal that carries an identity condition. As the most general category in ontology, it must satisfy 'Sortal Individuation' - every domain element must instantiate some property carrying an IC. Entity supplies the most basic identity condition: numerical identity (x=y). Each entity is self-identical and distinguishable from other entities through the identity relation itself. This is the foundational IC inherited by all more specific properties. Without this, we would violate Quine's 'No entity without identity' principle. Entity provides the minimal IC that 'something exists and can be distinguished as that particular thing' even if more specific ICs are provided by subsuming properties.	Entity is the most fundamental category in ontology - it represents anything that exists or can exist. As the top-level property in any ontological hierarchy, Entity must supply its own identity condition because there is no more general property from which it could inherit one. The identity condition for Entity is the most basic: numerical identity (x = y), meaning an entity is identical to itself and distinct from all other entities. Since Entity cannot inherit an IC from any superordinate property (there is none), it must supply this foundational IC itself, making it +O.	Entity is the most general ontological category encompassing anything that exists or can be identified. Its instances include both intrinsic wholes (like persons, cars) and non-wholes (like scattered collections, amounts of matter). Since Entity subsumes properties with incompatible unity conditions - some instances are +U (persons with biological integration), some are ~U (amounts of matter without intrinsic wholeness) - it cannot itself carry a common unity condition for all instances. By definition 11, a property carries unity only if ALL its instances are intrinsic wholes under some equivalence relation, which is clearly not the case for Entity. Therefore, Entity is -U (does not carry unity).	Entity represents the most fundamental and general category in ontology - anything that exists or can exist. By definition, entities at this level of abstraction do not intrinsically depend on other specific entities for their existence. Entity is a top-level universal concept that encompasses all possible things, including both dependent and independent instances. While specific subtypes of entities may carry dependence relationships, the concept of Entity itself does not require the existence of any other distinct entities. It satisfies the Sortal Individuation requirement while being maximally independent, as it represents existence itself rather than any particular mode of existence that would necessitate external dependence.	
Organization	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Organization	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Sortal (Rigid, supplies identity)	Organization is a rigid property because anything that is an organization is necessarily an organization in all possible worlds where it exists. An organization cannot cease to be an organization and become something else while remaining the same entity - if it loses its organizational structure and identity, it ceases to exist as that entity. While an organization can change its members, structure, or purpose, these are changes to its properties, not changes in whether it IS an organization. The entity is essentially an organization throughout its existence, making this a rigid property. This is similar to how Person is rigid - just as a person cannot cease to be a person while remaining the same individual, an organization cannot cease to be an organization while remaining the same organization.	Organization carries an identity condition. Organizations can be distinguished and re-identified over time through various means such as legal registration numbers, official names, founding documents, or institutional continuity. An organization like 'Microsoft Corporation' maintains its identity despite changes in employees, leadership, products, or even physical locations. The identity is tied to the legal and social entity itself, which persists through time with clear criteria for sameness (e.g., same legal charter, same institutional structure). Organizations are sortals because they provide principled ways to answer 'Is this the same organization?' across different times, even as their parts and properties change.	Organization supplies its own identity condition. As a rigid property (organizations maintain their identity through time despite changes in membership, leadership, or structure), it provides a global IC distinct from more general properties. Organizations can be identified through conditions like registration numbers, legal charters, or founding documents that establish organizational identity independent of their constituent members. This is unlike properties such as 'Group' or 'Collection' which would have different identity criteria based on membership composition. Organization establishes its own criterion for what makes one organization the same as or different from another across time, making it +O.	Organization carries a unity condition (+U). An organization is an intrinsic whole unified by functional and institutional relations among its members and parts. The unity relation is based on organizational structure, roles, responsibilities, and coordinated purposes that bind members together into a coherent entity. An organization maintains its mereological integrity through these functional relationships - members are not arbitrary parts but are bound by hierarchical, operational, and purposive connections. For example, a corporation has departments, employees, and resources unified by organizational charts, bylaws, and shared objectives. These parts are integrated through formal and informal institutional relations, making each organization an intrinsic whole under its specific organizational unity condition, even as individual members may change over time.	Organization is independent (-D). While organizations require members (people) to function, they do not have a necessary external dependence on any specific other entity type that is not a part or constituent of them. Members are constituents of the organization rather than external entities. An organization can continue to exist even as individual members change, and the organization as an entity does not intrinsically depend on any external entity class for its existence - it depends only on having some members, which are internal constituents, not external dependencies.	
Agent	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Agent	~R	+I	+O	-U	-D	Role or Phase (Anti-rigid)	Agent is anti-rigid because it represents a role or capacity that entities can acquire or lose. An entity (such as a person or organization) can become an agent by taking on the capacity to act, and can cease to be an agent without ceasing to exist. For example, a person remains a person even when not acting as an agent in a particular context. Being an agent is not essential to the identity of its instances - it's a contingent property that describes a functional role rather than an essential nature.	Agent carries an identity condition. Agents are entities capable of action and are typically grounded in some underlying sortals that supply identity criteria. Whether an agent is a person, organization, software system, or other entity type, there must be a principled way to distinguish one agent from another and re-identify the same agent over time - otherwise the notion of agency (performing actions, having goals, being responsible for outcomes) becomes incoherent. For human agents, this reduces to PERSON's identity criteria; for institutional agents, this may involve legal registration or constitutional documents; for software agents, this involves system identifiers. The property inherits or carries identity conditions from its more specific subtypes, making it +I even if it doesn't supply its own unique IC (+O vs +I distinction).	Agent supplies its own identity condition. As a fundamental category in ontology, Agent represents entities capable of action and agency. It provides its own identity criterion based on being a unified locus of autonomous behavior and goal-directed activity - an agent is identified as the same agent through time by virtue of maintaining continuous agency and intentional capacity. This is not inherited from a more general property but is supplied by Agent itself as a rigid sortal that distinguishes agents from non-agents (like mere physical objects or abstract entities). The identity condition for agents differs fundamentally from that of simple physical objects (which may use mereological criteria) or other categories, making Agent an +O property that supplies its own IC.	Agent does not carry a common unity condition for all its instances. While individual agents may be intrinsic wholes (e.g., a person as an integrated biological system, or an organization as a functionally unified entity), there is no single equivalence relation ω that provides a unity condition for all agents. Different types of agents (individual persons, AI systems, organizations, collective agents) have fundamentally different mereological structures and unifying relations. A person has topological and biological unity, while a corporate agent has functional and legal unity. This makes Agent a -U property rather than +U, as it lacks a uniform unity condition across all instances, though it is not ~U since many of its instances are indeed intrinsic wholes.	An Agent is an independent entity that can act autonomously and does not intrinsically depend on other specific entities for its existence. While agents may interact with environments, other agents, or objects, and may have relationships with them, these are not constitutive dependencies. An agent can exist and maintain its identity as an agent without necessarily requiring any specific external entity (that is not a part or constituent of the agent itself). The capacity for agency and action-taking is intrinsic to the agent, not dependent on external entities.	
Apple	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Apple	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Sortal (Rigid, supplies identity)	Apple is a rigid property because anything that is an apple is necessarily an apple in all possible worlds where it exists. An apple cannot cease to be an apple and remain the same individual entity - if it transforms into something else (e.g., applesauce, compost), it is no longer the same apple but a different entity. The property of being an apple is essential to the identity of any instance throughout its existence as that particular entity.	Apple carries an identity condition. As a physical object and natural kind (fruit), individual apples can be distinguished and re-identified through spatio-temporal continuity and material composition. Each apple maintains identity through time despite minor changes (ripening, small damage), has clear physical boundaries, and can be tracked as the same apple across different temporal instances. The property inherits identity conditions from its rigid superordinate properties like PHYSICAL OBJECT and FRUIT, which supply criteria for distinguishing one apple from another (e.g., same material constitution, same spatio-temporal trajectory).	Apple supplies its own identity condition as a natural kind (fruit). Individual apples can be distinguished and reidentified over time through their specific genetic makeup, cellular structure, and continuous spatiotemporal trajectory. While Apple inherits identity from more general properties like Physical Object, it supplies an additional, more specific IC relevant to the biological nature of apples (e.g., 'having the same biological origin and continuous organic structure'). This is distinct from and more specific than the general physical object IC, making Apple a property that supplies its own identity condition at its level of generality.	An apple is an intrinsic whole with topological, morphological, and functional unity. Its parts (skin, flesh, core, seeds, stem) are bound together by biological/physical connections and form a maximally self-connected object. The parts form an integrated biological structure where each component is connected to other parts and nothing else external to the apple. An apple maintains this unity condition throughout its existence as an apple - if significant parts are removed or the unity is destroyed, it ceases to be an apple (becoming instead 'apple pieces' or 'remains of an apple'). This satisfies Definition 11: all instances of Apple are intrinsic wholes under a consistent equivalence relation of biological/physical connection.	An apple is an independent physical object that does not intrinsically depend on other entities for its existence. Once an apple exists as a discrete fruit, it continues to exist as an apple regardless of whether the tree that produced it, the person who might eat it, or any other entity exists. While an apple may have come from a tree historically, it is not constitutively dependent on that tree or any other external entity to maintain its identity as an apple. It can exist and be identified as an apple in isolation.
