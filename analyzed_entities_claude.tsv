Agent	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Agent	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Sortal (Natural Kind or Category)	Agent is analyzed as a rigid property (+R) because being an agent is essential to all its instances across all possible worlds - an entity cannot gain or lose the fundamental capacity for agency while remaining the same individual. It carries identity (+I) and supplies its own identity condition (+O) based on the cognitive/volitional capacities that define agenthood - we can identify and distinguish agents by their ability to act intentionally and autonomously. Agent exhibits unity (+U) as instances (individual agents) are intrinsic wholes with integrated cognitive systems, not mere aggregates. It is independent (-D) because agents, as autonomous entities with their own decision-making capacity, do not intrinsically depend on other entities to exist - they are self-subsistent bearers of agency. This makes Agent a foundational sortal category that provides criteria for identity, individuation, and persistence of entities capable of intentional action.	
AmountOfMatter	http://example.org/guarino-messy#AmountOfMatter	+R	+I	+O	-U	-D	Sortal (Category/Kind)	AmountOfMatter is rigid (+R) because any instance remains an amount of matter in all possible worlds - it cannot cease to be matter while continuing to exist. It carries identity (+I) and supplies its own identity condition (+O) based on material composition and spatiotemporal continuity - what makes this particular amount of matter the same across time is determined by the property itself. It is non-unifying (-U) because amounts of matter can be scattered, divisible, or lack intrinsic wholeness (e.g., a pile of sand, scattered molecules). It is independent (-D) as amounts of matter do not intrinsically depend on other entities for their existence. As a rigid property carrying its own identity, AmountOfMatter qualifies as a Sortal, specifically a substantial Category/Kind in Guarino-Welty's taxonomy.	
Animal	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Animal	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Natural Kind	Animal is a rigid property (+R) because anything that is an animal is necessarily an animal in all possible worlds - a dog cannot cease to be an animal while continuing to exist. It carries identity (+I) and supplies its own identity condition (+O) through biological/organic criteria that distinguish one animal from another as discrete organisms. Animal is unifying (+U) as each instance is an intrinsic whole - a complete biological organism with integrated parts. It is independent (-D) because animals exist as autonomous entities without intrinsic existential dependence on other particulars. As a substance sortal with +R, +O, +U, and -D, Animal qualifies as a Natural Kind - a fundamental category for organizing biological entities.	
Apple	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Apple	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Sortal (Natural Kind)	An apple is a rigid property (+R) because anything that is an apple must be an apple in all possible worlds where it exists - an apple cannot cease being an apple and remain the same individual. It carries identity (+I) and supplies its own identity condition (+O) as a natural kind, providing criteria for recognizing and distinguishing individual apples through their biological/botanical essence. It has unity (+U) because each apple is an intrinsic whole with clear spatial boundaries and internal organization as a fruit. It is independent (-D) because an apple, once it exists as a discrete fruit, does not intrinsically depend on another particular entity for its existence (though it causally originated from a tree, the mature fruit can exist independently).	
Butterfly	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Butterfly	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Sortal (Natural Kind)	Butterfly is a rigid (+R) natural kind because any instance must be a butterfly in all possible worlds where it exists - a butterfly cannot cease being a butterfly and remain the same individual. It carries identity (+I) and supplies its own identity condition (+O) as a biological species/taxon with clear criteria for what counts as the same butterfly over time (biological continuity, DNA, developmental stages). It is unifying (+U) because each butterfly is an intrinsic whole - an integrated organism with spatially and functionally connected parts. It is independent (-D) as butterflies do not intrinsically depend on other entities for their existence (though they causally depend on environment, food, etc., this is not the intrinsic ontological dependence meant here). As a rigid sortal supplying its own identity (+R, +O), Butterfly qualifies as a Natural Kind in Guarino and Welty's framework.	
Caterpillar	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Caterpillar	~R	+I	-O	+U	-D	Phase	A caterpillar is a developmental phase in the life cycle of lepidopteran insects (butterflies and moths). **Rigidity (~R)**: Anti-rigid because being a caterpillar is a temporary, essential phase - no entity can be a caterpillar in all possible worlds throughout its existence; it necessarily transforms into a pupa and then adult. The property is essentially temporary. **Identity (+I)**: Carries identity inherited from its parent sortal (the specific insect species, e.g., Monarch Butterfly). The caterpillar maintains the same identity through metamorphosis. **Own Identity (-O)**: Does not supply its own identity condition - identity comes from the underlying biological organism/species, not from being a caterpillar per se. **Unity (+U)**: A caterpillar is an intrinsic whole - a complete, unified biological organism with integrated parts during this life stage. **Dependence (-D)**: While dependent on environmental factors, a caterpillar is not intrinsically dependent on another entity for its existence as a substance; it exists as an independent organism. As a Phase (anti-rigid sortal), 'Caterpillar' represents a temporary but necessary stage that instances pass through while maintaining their essential identity as members of their species.	
Country	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Country	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Sortal (Natural Type)	Country is +R (Rigid) because any instance that is a country must be a country in all possible worlds where it exists - France cannot cease being a country and remain the same entity (it would be a different political entity or cease to exist). It carries identity (+I) and supplies its own identity criteria (+O) through a combination of territorial boundaries, sovereign government, and political recognition. Country is +U (Unifying) as each instance forms an intrinsic whole with clear spatial, political, and organizational boundaries that unite its parts (territory, government, population). Finally, Country is -D (Independent) because countries exist as sovereign, self-standing geopolitical entities that do not intrinsically depend on other entities for their existence, though they may have practical dependencies and international relations.	
Entity	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Entity	+R	-I	-O	-U	-D	Category	Entity is the most general concept in ontology, applying rigidly to everything that exists (anything that is an entity necessarily remains so across all possible worlds). However, Entity does not carry any identity condition (+I would require specific criteria for distinguishing one entity from another, which Entity as a maximally general concept lacks). Since it doesn't carry identity, it cannot supply its own identity (-O follows from -I). Entity is non-unifying (-U) because entities range from unified wholes to arbitrary collections without any unifying principle at this level of generality. Finally, Entity is independent (-D) as it represents the broadest existential category with no intrinsic dependence constraints. As a rigid, non-identity-carrying property of maximum generality, Entity is classified as a Category in the Guarino-Welty framework.	
Food	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Food	-R	+I	+O	-U	-D	Type/Category	Food is non-rigid (-R) because an entity can become food (e.g., an apple becomes food when intended for consumption) or cease to be food (when spoiled beyond edibility). It carries identity (+I) inherited from the material substances that constitute it. It supplies its own identity (+O) as a functional kind - food items have identity conditions tied to their material constitution and functional properties. Food is non-unifying (-U) because 'food' can refer to single items (an apple) or collections (a meal, groceries) without intrinsic wholeness constraints. It is independent (-D) as food can exist without being consumed or related to eaters at a given moment, though its classification as 'food' depends on potential function. Food operates as a functional category rather than a natural kind, with membership determined by role in nutrition/consumption context.	
Fruit	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Fruit	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Sortal (Natural Kind)	Fruit is analyzed as a biological natural kind. **Rigidity (+R)**: An entity that is a fruit is essentially a fruit - an apple cannot cease being a fruit while continuing to exist as that same entity. This is rigid across all possible worlds. **Identity (+I) and Own Identity (+O)**: Fruit supplies its own identity condition as a biological structure - the mature ovary of a flowering plant containing seeds. This provides clear criteria for counting and individuating fruits. **Unity (+U)**: Each fruit instance is an intrinsic whole with structural and functional unity as an integrated botanical organ, not merely an aggregate. **Dependence (-D)**: While fruits developmentally originate from plants, a mature fruit can exist as an independent physical object after being separated from the parent plant (e.g., a picked apple). The fruit does not intrinsically require ongoing connection to another entity to maintain its existence as a fruit, though it will eventually decay.	
Group	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Group	-R	+I	+O	-U	-D	Sortal (Type)	Group is analyzed as follows: (1) Rigidity: -R (Non-Rigid) because an entity can be a group in some circumstances but not necessarily in all possible worlds - a collection might cease to be a group or become one. (2) Identity: +I (Carries Identity) because groups have identity conditions tied to their membership and constitution criteria. (3) Own Identity: +O (Supplies Identity) because 'Group' provides its own global identity condition based on membership relations and potentially shared properties or organization. (4) Unity: -U (Non-Unifying) because groups are typically collections of distinct members that don't necessarily form an intrinsic whole - members can be spatially separated and maintain individual existence. (5) Dependence: -D (Independent) because while a group depends on having members, as an abstract collective entity it doesn't intrinsically depend on any specific external entity beyond its constitutive members. Classification: Sortal Type - it provides identity criteria and is countable, though not rigid across all instances in all scenarios.	
GroupOfPeople	http://example.org/guarino-messy#GroupOfPeople	-R	+I	+O	~U	+D	Category	GroupOfPeople is non-rigid (-R) because an entity can be a group at one time and cease to be a group at another (e.g., when members disperse), yet the same persons could regroup. It carries identity (+I) and supplies its own identity condition (+O) based on its membership composition - a group is identified by who its members are. It exhibits anti-unity (~U) as groups are strictly aggregates/sums of individual people rather than intrinsic wholes - the parts (members) are spatially and functionally separate entities. It is dependent (+D) because a group cannot exist without its constituent members - at least two people must exist for there to be a group. The non-rigidity combined with supplying identity makes this a Category in Guarino-Welty's taxonomy, representing a property that provides identity but is not essential to all its instances across all possible worlds.	
LegalAgent	http://example.org/guarino-messy#LegalAgent	-R	+I	-O	+U	-D	Role	LegalAgent is a non-rigid property (~R or -R) because an entity (person, organization) can gain or lose the capacity to be a legal agent (e.g., through changes in legal status, jurisdiction, or capacity). It is not essential to all instances in all possible worlds - a person could exist without legal agency (e.g., before birth, in certain legal states). It carries identity (+I) inherited from its base sortal (Person, Organization), but does not supply its own identity condition (-O) - the identity comes from what the agent fundamentally is, not from being a legal agent. It has unity (+U) as legal agents are discrete, countable wholes. It is independent (-D) as the entity itself (person/organization) exists independently, though the legal agency status may depend on legal frameworks. Best classified as a Role because it represents a contingent, externally-grounded capacity that entities can acquire and lose while maintaining their identity.	
LivingBeing	http://example.org/guarino-messy#LivingBeing	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Sortal (Natural Kind)	LivingBeing is +R (Rigid) because being alive is essential to all its instances across all possible worlds - if something ceases to be living, it is no longer a LivingBeing but becomes something else (e.g., a corpse). It carries +I (Identity) and +O (Own Identity) as it supplies its own intrinsic identity condition based on biological continuity and organizational principles that distinguish one living organism from another. LivingBeing is +U (Unifying) because each instance is an intrinsic whole with integrated biological systems and functions, not merely an arbitrary sum of parts. It is -D (Independent) because living beings, while they may depend on environmental conditions, do not intrinsically depend on other specific entities for their existence as living beings - they are substantial entities. This combination (+R, +O, +U, -D) characterizes LivingBeing as a Natural Kind Sortal, representing a fundamental category of substance.	
Location	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Location	-R	+I	+O	-U	-D	Category	Location is a Non-Rigid (+/-R) property because entities can change locations - a person at home vs. at work remains the same person, so location is not essential to all instances in all possible worlds. It carries Identity (+I) as locations have clear identity conditions based on spatial coordinates or reference systems. It supplies its Own Identity (+O) through inherent spatial/geometric criteria (coordinates, boundaries, reference frames). Location is Non-Unifying (-U) because locations can be arbitrary spatial regions without requiring intrinsic wholeness - they can be disconnected areas or mere coordinate sets. Location is Independent (-D) as spatial positions exist independently and don't intrinsically depend on occupants. Given its non-rigidity and identity-carrying nature, Location functions as a Category - a property that subsumes entities across different essential types (buildings, coordinates, regions, points) without imposing essential constraints on its instances.	
Organization	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Organization	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Sortal (Natural Kind)	Organization is +R (Rigid) because an entity that is an organization is essentially an organization in all possible worlds where it exists - a corporation cannot stop being an organization while continuing to exist as the same entity. It carries +I (Identity) and supplies +O (Own Identity) through its organizational structure, founding principles, or legal constitution that distinguishes one organization from another. Organization is +U (Unity) because instances have intrinsic cohesion through their structural relationships, membership, and shared purpose - they are wholes rather than mere aggregates. Organization is -D (Independent) because while individual organizations may depend on members or resources, the property 'Organization' itself does not require intrinsic dependence on external entities - an organization can exist as a self-standing entity. This makes Organization a Sortal that provides identity criteria and essential classification for its instances.	
Person	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Person	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Sortal (Natural Kind)	Person is a rigid property (+R) because an entity that is a person in one world must be a person in all possible worlds where it exists - personhood is essential to the identity of its instances. It carries identity (+I) and supplies its own identity condition (+O) through biological and cognitive continuity criteria that distinguish one person from another. Person is unifying (+U) as each instance forms an intrinsic whole with integrated biological, psychological, and social properties rather than being a mere aggregate. Finally, Person is independent (-D) because persons do not intrinsically depend on other entities for their existence - while they may have causal dependencies (parents, environment), they are not ontologically dependent in the sense that a hole depends on its host or a role depends on a player. As a rigid property that supplies its own identity and unity criteria, Person qualifies as a Sortal, specifically a Natural Kind.	
PhysicalObject	http://example.org/guarino-messy#PhysicalObject	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Sortal (Kind)	PhysicalObject is a rigid property (+R) because anything that is a physical object is necessarily so in all possible worlds - it cannot cease to be a physical object while continuing to exist. It carries identity (+I) and supplies its own identity condition (+O) based on spatio-temporal continuity and physical constitution, making it a sortal that provides criteria for individuation and recognition. PhysicalObject has unity (+U) as physical objects are typically intrinsic wholes with spatial boundaries and cohesive parts. It is independent (-D) since physical objects do not intrinsically require other entities to exist - they are foundational entities in the material domain. This combination of +R, +O, +U makes PhysicalObject a prototypical Kind (or Category) in the ontological hierarchy, serving as a substance sortal that grounds the identity of its instances.	
Red	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Red	-R	-I	-O	-U	+D	Quality/Property	Red is a color quality that is non-rigid (-R) because an object can gain or lose redness (e.g., an apple turning from green to red). It does not carry identity conditions (-I, -O) because being red does not provide criteria for identifying and distinguishing individuals - multiple distinct things can be red without 'red' telling us what makes each one the same entity over time. Red is non-unifying (-U) as it doesn't determine a whole - red things don't form intrinsic wholes merely by being red (a red car and red paint are both red but unrelated). Red is dependent (+D) because redness cannot exist independently - it must inhere in some substrate (an object, surface, or light). As a quality, Red represents an attribute that entities may possess contingently rather than a sortal that supplies identity criteria.	
RedApple	http://example.org/guarino-messy#RedApple	-R	+I	-O	+U	-D	Role	RedApple is non-rigid (-R) because an apple can lose the property of being red (e.g., through ripening or decay) while remaining the same apple. It carries identity (+I) inherited from 'Apple', which is a sortal that provides identity criteria for physical objects. However, RedApple does not supply its own identity condition (-O); it depends on the identity criteria from 'Apple' itself. The color 'red' is merely a contingent property. RedApple has unity (+U) as instances are intrinsic wholes (complete physical objects). It is independent (-D) because a red apple does not intrinsically depend on other entities for its existence beyond standard material object dependencies. The classification as Role reflects that 'being red' is a contingent, anti-rigid property that an apple can gain or lose, though it could also be considered a restrictive Mixin or Phase depending on interpretation. Given the temporary nature of color properties in fruits, Role is most appropriate.	
SocialEntity	http://example.org/guarino-messy#SocialEntity	-R	+I	+O	-U	+D	Category	SocialEntity is a high-level category representing entities that exist through social construction and collective recognition (organizations, institutions, groups, etc.). **Rigidity (-R)**: Non-rigid because something can become or cease to be a social entity (e.g., a group of people becomes an organization when formally constituted, then dissolves). **Identity (+I, +O)**: Social entities carry and supply their own identity conditions based on social conventions, membership rules, constitutive documents, or collective intentionality - distinct from physical objects. **Unity (-U)**: Non-unifying because social entities vary widely - some are highly integrated wholes (a corporation), others are loose collections (a social movement). They lack the intrinsic physical unity of material objects. **Dependence (+D)**: Dependent because social entities ontologically depend on human minds, social practices, and collective recognition for their existence - they cannot exist without cognitive agents who recognize and maintain them. As a broad Category with non-rigid instances, it subsumes more specific sortals like Organization, Institution, and Group.	
Vertebrate	http://example.org/guarino-messy#Vertebrate	+R	+I	+O	+U	-D	Natural Kind	Vertebrate is a rigid (+R) property because having a vertebral column (backbone) is essential to all its instances across all possible worlds - an organism cannot gain or lose vertebrate status. It carries identity (+I) and supplies its own identity condition (+O) through biological/anatomical criteria that distinguish vertebrates as a natural kind. Vertebrate instances are unifying (+U) as they are intrinsic biological wholes with integrated anatomical systems centered around the vertebral column. They are independent (-D) as vertebrate organisms exist as complete entities without intrinsic dependence on other entities for their existence. As a biological natural kind with rigid, identity-carrying, and unifying properties, Vertebrate qualifies as a Sortal that supplies identity criteria for its instances.
