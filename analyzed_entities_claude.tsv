It does not carry identity conditions - what makes something 'the same food' is determined by its underlying substance (apple, bread, meat), not by the property of being food itself. Food does not supply its own identity condition, as it relies on the identity of the underlying material or substance. Unity is non-unifying because food can be a whole item (an apple) or a portion/aggregate (a plate of rice). Dependence is independent in the formal sense - while food must be consumable by some organism conceptually, the physical instance (the apple, the grain) can exist independently of being consumed or of a consumer being present. Food is best classified as a Mixin - a non-rigid dispersive property that can apply to entities with different identity conditions across different contexts.""
